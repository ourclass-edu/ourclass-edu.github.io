Posts are typically displayed in [reverse chronological order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_chronology \"Reverse chronology\"), so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page \"Web page\"). Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*] occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or \ntopic. In the 2010s, \"multi-author blogs\" (MABs) emerged, featuring the \nwriting of multiple authors and sometimes professionally [edited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing \"Editing\"). MABs from [newspapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper \"Newspaper\"), other [media outlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media \"News media\"), universities, [think tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank \"Think tank\"), [advocacy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group \"Advocacy group\"), and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog [traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_traffic \"Web traffic\"). The rise of [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter \"Twitter\") and other \"[microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging \"Microblogging\")\" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. *Blog* can also be used as a verb, meaning *to maintain or add content to a blog*.\n\nThe emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided \nwith the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of \ncontent by non-technical users who did not have much experience with [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML \"HTML\") or [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming \"Computer programming\"). Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and [File Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol \"File Transfer Protocol\") had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker \"Hacker\") and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 \"Web 2.0\") websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this \ninteractivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-2) In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of [social networking service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service \"Social networking service\").\n Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but \nalso often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-3) However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.\n\nMany blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, \nranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics, and \nsports. Others function as more personal [online diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_diary \"Online diary\") or [online brand advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising \"Online advertising\") of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, [digital images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image \"Digital image\"), and [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink \"Hyperlink\") to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The \nability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact \nwith other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of\n many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often [moderate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum#Moderators \"Internet forum\") and [filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordfilter \"Wordfilter\") online comments to remove [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech \"Hate speech\") or other offensive content. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (*[art blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_blog \"Art blog\")*), photographs (*[photoblogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoblog \"Photoblog\")*), videos (*[video blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_blog \"Video blog\")* or \"*vlogs*\"), music (*[MP3 blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3_blog \"MP3 blog\")*), and audio (*[podcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast \"Podcast\")*). In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as *[edublogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edublog \"Edublog\")*. [Microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging \"Microblogging\") is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.\n\n'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media \"Social media\"),\n especially when the content is long-form and one creates and shares \ncontent on regular basis. So, one could be maintaining a blog on [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\") or blogging on [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram \"Instagram\").\n\nOn February 16, 2011, there were over 156 million public blogs in existence.\nOn February 20, 2014, there were around 172 million [Tumblr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr \"Tumblr\")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-4) and 75.8 million [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress.com \"WordPress.com\")[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-5) blogs in existence worldwide.

You\n are probably wondering where and how to get the services from. Read on \nto this guide, for we will explain step by step everything you need to \nknow to fix your phone.\n\n- Google it!\n\nFirst and foremost, you need a reputable company that could fix your \nphone. So open the web browser and in the google search engine type, ‘Cell Phone Repair near me',\n and it will give you a list of places you get your phone fixed from. \nAlways remember, not every company lives by its claim, so do a little \ninvestigation before choosing to opt for one repairing company.\n\n- Check the cost\n\nThe repairing cost, although varies on a lot of factors, you should \nonly pay for the services that you think are worthwhile. However, keep \nin mind the following factors.\n\n- The phone kind \n\nSome phones are more complicated than others, therefore do not get \noffended if you are getting charged more for your screen damage than \nsomeone you know. Usually, older models are cheaper to repair than the \nmore advanced or newer models. Similarly, you will notice a repair price\n difference in Apple, Windows, and Android phones.\n\n- The fixture type\n\nWhat you are having fixed influences the cost like nothing else. So \nyou can not expect to pay the same price for getting your phone and \nbattery fixed. \n\n- Check the screen repair\n\n If you have gotten the spiderweb-like patterns on your phone screen, then you need to get your screen fixed immediately.\n\n- Where to go?\n\nYou can either check the warranty and send it to the manufacturers. \nDoing so will save you from spending a big chunk of your money, but this\n might also take longer.\n\n- The water damage\n\nLike every other damage, the cost of water damage in your phone \nvaries. The greater the extent of damage the more you would be charged.\n\n1. First, get your phone examined. There are some generous repair shops\n  like Regina Mobile Q that will give a free diagnostic check. After a \n  thorough examination, the repairers will let you know what you can \n  expect to pay.\n  \n2. Unfortunately not every water damage can be examined right away. \n  Sometimes, even after getting your phone repaired, you come home to \n  realize that you have not completely got the problem solved. The bottom \n  line is, you should always be prepared to pay for your phone repair \n  unless it is totally out of your budget.\n  \n\n- Does Phone repairs affect the warranty?\n\nIt is a commonly held misconception that getting your phone repaired \nwill affect its warranty. So the good news is, you can get your phone \nfixed all the while retaining its warranty. Nevertheless, before buying \nan expensive phone or any expensive electronic device, you should make \nsure you are aware of the policies and protection plan.\n\nToday, cell phones have a computing power greater than the computers \nof a decade ago. The modern features in your phone allow you to not just\n communicate, but also learn and entertain yourself. Therefore, a phone \nnot working right can affect your life more than you can anticipate. \nMany different phone companies make different products and that is why \ndetecting the issue in your phone is sometimes a task per se. Therefore,\n it is always best to leave the complicated work in the hand of experts.","date":1615314960000,"_id":"3xlgwgo03BSbfXJM"}

Their \nhabitat lies on the Eastern side of the Olympic mountain range, adjacent\n to Hood Canal. These solitary cephalopods reach an average size \n(measured from arm-tip to mantle-tip,) of 30-33 cm. Unlike most other \ncephalopods, tree octopuses are amphibious, spending only their early \nlife and the period of their mating season in their ancestral aquatic \nenvironment. Because of the moistness of the rainforests and specialized\n skin adaptations, they are able to keep from becoming desiccated for \nprolonged periods of time, but given the chance they would prefer \nresting in pooled water.\n\n![Tree octopus photo](https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/treeocto_enlarged.jpg)*Rare photo of the elusive tree octopus (Enhanced from cropped telephoto)*\n\nAn intelligent and inquisitive being (it has the largest \nbrain-to-body ratio for any mollusk), the tree octopus explores its \narboreal world by both touch and sight. Adaptations its ancestors \noriginally evolved in the three dimensional environment of the sea have \nbeen put to good use in the spatially complex maze of the [coniferous Olympic rainforests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_National_Park).\n The challenges and richness of this environment (and the intimate way \nin which it interacts with it,) may account for the tree octopus's \nadvanced behavioral development. (Some evolutionary theorists suppose \nthat \"arboreal adaptation\" is what laid the groundwork in primates for \nthe evolution of the human mind.)\n\nReaching out with one of her eight arms, each covered in sensitive \nsuckers, a tree octopus might grab a branch to pull herself along in a \nform of locomotion called tentaculation; or she might be preparing to \nstrike at an insect or small vertebrate, such as a frog or rodent, or \nsteal an egg from a bird's nest; or she might even be examining some \nobject that caught her fancy, instinctively desiring to manipulate it \nwith her dexterous limbs (really deserving the title \"sensory organs\" \nmore than mere \"limbs\",) in order to better know it.\n\n![Tree octopus range map](https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/tree_octopus_range_map.png)*Map of estimated tree octopus maximum range, including spawning waters*\n\nTree octopuses have eyesight comparable to humans. Besides allowing \nthem to see their prey and environment, it helps them in inter-octopus \nrelations. Although they are not social animals like us, they display to\n one-another their emotions through their ability to change the color of\n their skin: red indicates anger, white fear, while they normally \nmaintain a mottled brown tone to blend in with the background.\n\nThe reproductive cycle of the tree octopus is still linked to its \nroots in the waters of the Puget Sound from where it is thought to have \noriginated. Every year, in Spring, tree octopuses leave their homes in \nthe [Olympic National Forest](http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/) and migrate towards the shore and, eventually, their spawning grounds \nin Hood Canal. There, they congregate (the only real social time in \ntheir lives,) and find mates. After the male has deposited his sperm, he\n returns to the forests, leaving the female to find an aquatic lair in \nwhich to attach her strands of egg-clusters. The female will guard and \ncare for her eggs until they hatch, refusing even to eat, and usually \ndying from her selflessness. The young will spend the first month or so \nfloating through Hood Canal, Admiralty Inlet, and as far as North Puget \nSound before eventually moving out of the water and beginning their \nadult lives.\n\n### Why It's Endangered\n\n![](https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/route101-large.jpg)*Route 101, separating the rainforests of the Olympic Peninsula from Hood Canal*\n\nAlthough the tree octopus is not officially listed on the Endangered\nSpecies List, we feel that it should be added since its numbers are at a\n critically low level for its breeding needs. The reasons for this dire \nsituation include: decimation of habitat by logging and suburban \nencroachment; building of roads that cut off access to the water which \nit needs for spawning; predation by foreign species such as house cats; \nand booming populations of its natural predators, including the bald \neagle and [sasquatch](https://zapatopi.net/bsa/octopus.html).\n What few that make it to the Canal are further hampered in their \nreproduction by the growing problem of pollution from farming and \nresidential run-off. Unless immediate action is taken to protect this \nspecies and its habitat, the Pacific Northwest tree octopus will be but a\n memory.\n\nThe possibility of Pacific Northwest tree octopus extinction is not \nan unwarranted fear. Other tree octopus species—including the Douglas \noctopus and the red-ringed madrona sucker—were once abundant throughout \nthe Cascadia region, but have since gone extinct because of threats \nsimilar to those faced by *paxarbolis*, as well as overharvesting by the now-illegal tree octopus trade.\n\n![Cascadia Evening Post](https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/cascadia_evening_post-1923-11.jpg \"Cover of 1923 'Cascadia Evening Post' featuring woman wearing Tree Octopus hat\")*Tree Octopus hat from 1923*\n\nThe history of the tree octopus trade is a sad one. Their voracious \nappetite for bird plumes having exhausted all the worthy species of that\n family, the fashionistas moved on to cephalopodic accoutrements during \nthe early 20th Century. Tree octopuses became prized by the fashion \nindustry as ornamental decorations for hats, leading greedy trappers to \nwipe out whole populations to feed the vanity of the fashionable rich. \nWhile fortunately this practice has been outlawed, its effects still \nreverberate today as these millinery deprivations brought tree octopus \nnumbers below the critical point where even minor environmental change \ncould cause disaster.\n\nWhile efforts were made in the past to preserve remaining tree \noctopus habitat, these were met with resistance by the timber industry, \nwhich has traditionally viewed the tree octopus [as a nuisance](https://zapatopi.net/blog/?post=200812287770.an_octopus_in_a_saw-mill),\n both because the octopuses favor the valuable, moss-shrouded trees of \nold growth forests—pitting conservation needs against lucrative sources \nof lumber—and because octopuses hiding among felled trees often gummed \nup sawmills and stained pulp vats with their ink.\n\n![](https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/bones_hartzell-tree_octopus_exhibit.jpg)*Traveling sideshow exhibits, such as this one by Glen \"Bones\" Hartzell from 1942, demonized tree octopuses to the ignorant masses.*\n\nThese nuisances led many loggers to regard tree octopuses as bad \nluck, resulting in the pointless killing of octopuses on sight at \nlogging camps in a misguided attempt at eradicating the troublesome \nspecies. Anti-octopus sentiment was so strong among loggers that some \neven began to fear that the octopuses were prone to attacking humans.\n\nThese fears were fueled in no small part by gratuitous stories \ninvolving tree octopuses harassing lumberjacks and distressing damsels \nin Northwestern-themed pulp magazines of the 1930-40s and variously \n\"nipping\", \"entangling\", or \"suckering the flesh\" of the heroes of men's\n action magazines of the 1950-60s. (The magazine publishers depended on \ncheap paper made from wood pulp and were glad to contribute to the \nanti-octopus propaganda campaign of the timber industry.)\n\nTo this day, misunderstanding and fear of these gentle creatures can \nstill be found among many old timers, although education campaigns—and \nspecial octopus-separators installed at sawmills—have largely halted the\n practice of tree octopus eradication.\n\n### How You Can Help\n\n#### Activism:\n\nWant to become a Tree Octopus Activist?

More powerful design of the blower wheel by Canada Blower improved the integrity of reinforced blades on backward curved and airfoil fans. Made of thicker gauge material and with several reinforcement options, this design is the answer when nothing else will do.\n\nThis feature doubles the dignity and expectations of higher efficiency. Development was carried out by leading engineers in the industry who have made a significant contribution to make a blower wheel more efficient. Hence, retrofitting of a blower wheel can be done with reinforcement of blades.\n\nIn this process our engineers design a new impeller by considering the parameters such as air-flow rate, system resistance, density of gas at the inlet, site altitude and temperature of gases inlet of the existing fan. With the above points taking into consideration, an impeller is designed having a diameter which is almost nearer to the existing one, so that it fits perfectly in the casing without any necessity for modification or replacement.\n\nSeveral factors are to be considered when material to be handled is going through the fan system. Choosing a fan with proper blade type is important otherwise the material will be accumulated on the blades. For clean air applications backward curved and airfoil blades with reinforcement are very efficient, whereas if the material is dirty and granular, radial wheels are appropriate.\n\nIn order to produce the highest performance wheels on the market, our laboratory tests our reinforced blower wheels under these high-stress levels to gain an understanding of where wheels can be redesigned and enhanced to avoid any deformation. These over-speed tests are imperative to finding solutions for customers who need high performance wheels with durability they can trust.\n\nWhile handling moist or wet materials, fans with special coatings or material liners need to be used for wheels to avoid material corrosion and abrasion.\n\nComing to reinforcement of industrial blower wheels has many advantages and can be easily performed with less investment and in less time period.\n\n Canada Blower is larger North American supplier of Industrial Fans & Blowers. Canada Blower's experienced enginnering team provides a quick assistance selecting appropriate ventilation equipment, replacment parts like Blower Wheel, Shaft, Inlet Cone, Housing, MotorArticle Search, Drives etc.","date":1615207620000,"_id":"57RTqLTyrWbOOll3"}

The term was a fantasy for storytellers and \ntechnological bodies until recently. The current virtual reality era \n(VR) started in 2010 when an American teenager devised the first VR \nheadset. From that day until this, every technology person has invested \nin it, which has popularized it across the globe. From different \nindustrial uses to entertainment purposes like gaming, VR is helping \nevery sector. \n\nWhat is Virtual Reality Gaming?\n\nComputer games have always been attractive and fun for kids and \nadults alike. With technological advancements taking everything and \nevery sector, the entertainment sector is no different. The new \ngeneration of computer games is virtual reality (VR) gaming. The game \naction is more defined, close to reality, and immersive when played with\n a VR headset. The player experiences and influences the game \nenvironment through advanced gaming accessories and devices.\n\nVR Gaming Devices:\n\nNumerous VR gaming devices are attracting gamers of different \nmentalities. These devices have their internal app stores where games \ncan be accessed. Most of the devices have the internal access option \nenable, but some don't have it. The apps and games in such devices are \naccessed using a computer system. Following is a list of VR gaming \ndevices.\n\n1. Oculus Rift:\n\nThe first VR gaming device was the oculus rift, which was introduced \nback in 2016. It was initially from the Oculus VR website and gradually \npenetrated the retail market. Initially, the device was not supported by\n ordinary computer systems, but it got easier with time. Computer \ncompanies like Dell, Hp, and Asus are now launching VR-ready machines, \nwhere you can play games of your choice.\n\nBest Oculus rift games:\n\nFollowing are some of the best games and apps you can try on this device.\n\n- Chronos\n  \n- Minecraft VR\n  \n- Elite: Dangerous\n  \n- Keep talking, and nobody explodes\n  \n- The Climb\n  \n- EVE: The Valkyrie\n  \n\n2. HTC Vive:\n\nThe two companies introduced the HTC Vive device. One is the \nTaiwanese tech firm HTC and the other is the games company Valve. Being a\n gaming company, Valve added a VR category to its existing gaming \nstream, whereas HTC launched a site for non-gaming apps. As a player, \nyou need a powerful PC to play the games, and HTC helps the buyers get \nthe right kit for the best VR experience.\n\nBest HTC Vive games and apps:\n\nYou can try the following games and apps with an HTC Vive gaming device:\n\n- Job Simulator\n  \n- Cosmic Trip\n  \n- The Brookhaven Experiment\n  \n- Tilt Brush Jaunt VR\n  \n- Apollo 11 VR\n  \n- AltSpace VR\n  \n\n3. Sony Playstation VR:\n\nThe Sony PlayStation VR headset was introduced as an accessory for \nthe Playstation 4 games console. Both the PS4 and PS4 pro support the VR\n headset; however, the pro version supports higher resolutions. A \nstandard console controller is used to run the VR headset on the PS with\n the DualShock 4. Moreover, there s an extra feature called VR social \nscreen show, where your friends can join or watch your game.\n\nGames and apps to try:\n\nWith a Sony Playstation, you should not miss out on the following games and apps.\n\n- Rez Infinite\n  \n- Tumble VR\n  \n- Batman: Arkham VR\n  \n- Thumper\n  \n- Job Simulator\n  \n- Playstation VR world\n  \n- Headmaster\n  \n- Driveclub VR\n  \n\n4.

This is by driven to help meet classroom expectation \nfor student success.\n\n#### Apply theories of curriculum to PK-12 instructional practices\n\nApplying curriculum and instructional approach allow educators to\n appreciate techniques that will merge everything all together in the \nsubject matter and learning objective. When educators us this method \nthey are taking in accountability. This approach provides educators with\n choices to incorporate in their lesson plans. This will allow students \nto become independent and successful in the classrooms. Applying \ncurriculum and instructional approaches offers support to educators that\n will allow them to use guidelines and set goals. Know matter what \nstudents are the center of when creating curriculum. It is the educator \nthat will make sure students are meeting all expectations concerning the\n content objectives. Therefore, applying curriculum provides and using \ndifferent approaches will promote success. This will also give students \nthe understanding as facilities. This is why educators are able to \nattend trainings. Every educator ought to be prepared to meet needs to \nallow students to be involved in a deeper understanding.\n\n#### Analyze curriculum models supporting differentiated PK-12 instructional practices.\n\nAnalyzing and breaking down the curriculum models means setting \nthe standards for students’ success. The curriculum models are to help \neducators plan accordingly so they are able to equip students to prepare\n for the real world. Examining the curriculum models introduces PK-12 \nstudents with a quality of education. Educators differentiate their \nlesson plans to meet the needs of students. This ensure that students \nwill gain the knowledge to succeed in the classrooms. The curriculum \nmodel support and meet PK-12 content objectives.\n\n#### Evaluate technology supporting differentiated PK-12 instructional practices.\n\nEducators use different strategies in order to meet the needs of \ntheir students. Technology plays a major role in the opportunity of \ndifferentiation in the classroom. According to (Oliva, & Gordon, \n2013), it is important that school districts supply technology for their\n students to use in the classrooms. Technology in the classroom is \ndesign to make teaching and learning easy for educators and for \nstudents. Students learn better with tools that are engaging and \nmeaningful. Technology prepares students for the real world and teaches \nthem how to become critical thinkers (McQuarrie, 2010).\n\n#### Determine current educational issues and trends and the impact on PK-12 curriculum.\n\nAny educational issues in the school may affect students in many \nways. Every year educators are allowing the take on some sort of \ntraining that impact the way student are learning in the classroom. It \nmay impact students the daily routines that will allow students to be \nmore focused during instructional times. Educational issues and \neducational trends will help prepare students to with the techniques of \napplying test taking skills during assessments.\n\n#### The issues and trends help keep students for the No Child Left Behind Rule.\n\nThe NCLB act has the ability to make certain that all students \nare receiving the right to learn. There are actual laws such as the NCLB\n act that would prevent certain issues and trends from interfering in \nthe classrooms. This act also provides excellent learning is taking \nplace in the classrooms. According to the (NCLB, 2020) it is an act that\n makes sure that students and educators or held accountable for what \ntake in the classroom. With its ensuring to making every account for \ntheir part in the learning process will allow students to become \nsuccessful in the classrooms. Whatever the students are need students \nwill benefit from the No Child Left Behind Act.\n\n#### Relate PK-12 curriculum processes to standards supporting current educational requirements\n\nSchool districts, educators and state support students in so many\n ways. Students support are required from every stakeholder. In the \nsupport to the current requirements schools have revised the standards \nin order to support students academically (Tomlinson, 2000). In the \npast, schools or district was not very effectively in supporting \nstudents with the right materials to help students with resources. The \nprocess requires a full plan that includes student’s data to be viewed. \nThis will give student the ability to improve overtime.","date":1614655020000,"_id":"Fj7vPOlbrzg5Os7P"}

It has long been recognized....","featured":0,"tags":"science info chemistry"},"content":"![Head Image](/assets/chemistry.jpg)\nOne of the most interesting questions in Chemistry is why [significant figures](http://significantfigurescalculator.com/) are important in Chemistry. It has long been recognized that in any \nchemical process, whether it is drying or heating, any change in the \namount of a certain element will impact the performance of that process.\n\nThe same is true in the study of why significant numbers are \nimportant in chemistry. In this article, I will explore this question \nfrom a different perspective.\n\nIn common parlance, a unit of measure is any quantity that can be \nassigned a value. This can be in the form of mass, volume, area, length,\n time, etc. A chemistry unit is considered the number of molecules in \none molecule. A macroscopic unit is the sum of the atomic and molecular \nproperties of a molecule. A macroscopic unit is the total amount of \nmatter composing the atomic or molecular structure of that molecule.\n\nWith the use of too many units in any process, we get in trouble with\n accuracy. No matter how small they are, any changes can affect the \nresults of the calculations and estimates. If this happens, the \ncalculations are inaccurate. This means that the calculations are wrong \nmost of the time.\n\nThe question then becomes, \"How many units should be used in a \nchemical process?\" The answer to this question is dependent on several \nconsiderations. The relevance of these considerations will vary \ndepending on the type of calculation being done, but one factor will \nremain consistent.\n\nWhy are significant numbers important in chemistry? The relevance of \nsignificant values cannot be underestimated. The fact is that when you \ndecide to make a calculation, whether inorganic or organic chemistry, \nyou always want to know the answer to a significant number of decimal \npoints. This way, you can make sure that your calculations are accurate.\n\nInorganic chemistry deals mainly with the properties of compounds. \nThe properties of a compound determine its toxicity, solubility, and \nreactivity. These all affect why they are important in chemistry.\n\nWhy are significant numbers important in organic chemistry? The \nsignificance of several units refers to the fact that it has a great \nimpact on the calculations. Take, for example, the valence (or \nprominence) of a molecule. A higher number of higher ranks indicate \nhigher importance. This means that the more prevalent a molecule is, the\n more significant it is in toxicity.\n\nBecause higher concentrations of a molecule will tend to dominate the\n system. If a few percent of the molecules in the system are of high \nenough concentrations, the rest will tend to be much less potent. Thus, \nwe conclude that concentrations of the molecule play a vital role in \ndetermining the potency of the molecule. We also know that the less \ncommon a molecule is, the more important its significance.\n\nWhy are significant units important in chemistry? Because units like \nmolecules and atoms have different significance in chemistry. Molecules \nwith one carbon atom are less significant than molecules with one \nhydrogen atom. Similarly, the more numerous the atoms are, the more \nsignificance their presence gives.\n\nBecause the greater the number of times a particular unit is \nmultiplied, the more significant its significance becomes. Thus, the \nmore times a molecule is formed, the more important it is for the \nchemical reaction. The more molecular entities there are for a given \nchemical reaction, the more significant its significance is. If we were \nto compare a molecule with a proton, it would not be too hard to see \nwhere the similarities end.\n\nWhy are significant units important in chemistry? There are many \nreasons. But perhaps the most important reason is that a higher \nsignificance of a molecule will ensure that the chemical reaction \nprocess will be more efficient.\n\nThis is why many people study the properties of different molecules, \nas this will help them determine the importance of their existence for \nthe overall chemical reaction. This is also why students are encouraged \nto learn about the properties of different units of substances so they \ncan perform more accurately in their experiments.\n\nIs it easy to memorize the significance of a molecule in a chemical \nreaction? It's not that difficult. If you know how to do the necessary \ncalculations, you don't have to worry. All you have to remember is the \nnumber of times the unit involved in the chemical reaction is multiplied\n by the amount of energy required to make the reaction happen. And this \nis something you can memorize quite easily, especially if you use formulas of some kind.","date":1615077240000,"_id":"MD5oQackpw40Ya2n"}

Explain your response. I believe that it is the teacher’s...","featured":0,"tags":"general education teaching tips"},"content":"![Head Image](/assets/improve.jpg)\n#### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. Is it the responsibility of teachers to teach study skills strategies? Explain your response.\n  \n\n- I believe that it is the teacher’s responsibility to teach study skills \n  strategies. First and foremost, when students harbor study skills, \n  teachers would spend less time re-teaching certain content because \n  students did not grasp the content in the beginning.  Study skills \n  strategies refer to things individuals have to do when they need to \n  locate and remember information. For example, being organized is a study\n   skill that should be taught. It is pertinent for teachers to understand\n   that the majority of organization methods do not work for all students,\n   therefore, teachers’ must teach different organizational strategies. \n  When students are organized, they will allocate information quicker, \n  coupled with, teachers teaching memorization strategies. Memorization \n  skills consist of forms of repeating or re-writing the information or \n  using flashcards. Looking at long pages of information or notes will not\n   help students retain any information. Finally, every student needs to \n  be taught note-taking strategies. Not only should teachers teach the \n  importance of note-taking, but they should teach various strategies. For\n   example, if a student is taught to review notes periodically, they \n  would be able to reiterate what they’ve learned, plus, it will give them\n   the opportunity to retain any information they’ve missed the first \n  time. If students are taught study skills strategies, they will be able \n  to use the information effectively. In addition, students with executive\n   functions deficits would succeed academically if they are explicitly \n  taught how to approach academic tasks. That being said, every teacher \n  should devote their time to help students learn *how* to study.\n  \n\n2. Which study skills strategies can improve students’ academic performance?\n  \n\n- There are several study skills strategies that can improve a student’s \n  academic performance. Some study skills strategies consist of *graphic organizers,* *comprehension\n   strategies, mnemonic strategies, note-taking strategies, organization \n  strategies, time management, and self-regulation.* First and \n  foremost, graphic organizers help students organize information, compare\n   the relationship between ideas, and apply information. In addition, \n  graphic organizers help students make connections to what they already \n  know. Comprehension strategies help students identify relevant \n  information within a text and make connections to prior knowledge. This \n  is important because students who have learning difficulties often \n  experience challenges in processing information, as a result, it will \n  affect their ability to understand the text. Mnemonic strategies are \n  known as memory strategies. Mnemonic strategies utilize visual or \n  auditory clues to help students make connections to what they know and \n  new information. Note-taking strategies help students understand \n  information that is presented in books and lectures, it helps students \n  process important information, and keep them engaged with the material. \n  Organization strategies can improve student’s academic performance by \n  helping them stay on-task, prepared, and efficient, whereas, students \n  who are not organized will most likely face academic challenges. For \n  example, if a student records their next assignment on a piece of paper \n  and accidentally throw it away, the student will be at risk of failing \n  that assignment due to unpreparedness. Time management strategies help \n  students gain a sense of how long an assignment might take. Without it, \n  students will overestimate or underestimate the time needed to complete a\n   task. Last but not least, self-regulation strategies help students use \n  learning strategies. For instance, students will be able to grasp the \n  idea of knowing when to use a certain strategy. The four self-regulation\n   strategies are self-monitoring, keeping track of progress; \n  self-instruction, students create encouraging statements through a task \n  or activity; goal setting establishes achievable objectives for \n  learning; and self-reinforcement, students uses intrinsic rewards when \n  something has been completed. \n\n#### Assessment\n\n1. Because students with learning difficulties often have deficits in executive functions, they are at risk of academic failure.\n  \n  1. List four critical activities related to learning that might be affected by these deficits.\n\n- In this day and age, students are expected to read independently and \n  extract information from textbooks, complete assignments with \n  multi-steps, and use appropriate study strategies. This is due to \n  increasing expectations and difficult content, however, students with \n  learning difficulties and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are \n  at risk of failing than are their peers without disabilities. One major \n  reason why students struggle is because they have deficits in executive \n  functions. Executive functions are the mental processes that regulate \n  and coordinate activities related to learning, including processing \n  information, retaining and recalling information, organizing materials \n  and time, and using effective learning and study strategies. If students\n   learn how to gain and use information effectively, then students who \n  have executive function deficits need to be explicitly taught how to \n  approach academic tasks strategically. Therefore, they need to be taught\n   effective study skills. Individual strategies can be implemented to \n  address problems students might have with four critical activities \n  associated with learning. The four processes include *processing \n  information, retaining and recalling information, organizing materials \n  and managing time, and selecting, monitoring and using strategies.*\n  \n  2. For each of these activities, identify at least one study skills \n    strategy that might help these students to improve their academic \n    performance.\n- If students learn how to gain and use information effectively, then \n  students who have executive function deficits need to be explicitly \n  taught how to approach academic tasks strategically. Therefore, they \n  need to be taught effective study skills. Individual strategies can be \n  implemented to address problems students might have with four critical \n  activities associated with learning. Activities related to learning \n  consist of *processing information, retaining and recalling \n  information, organizing materials and managing time, and selecting, \n  monitoring and using strategies.*\n  \n  First, *processing information* study skills \n  strategy requires the use of graphic organizers. There are several \n  graphic organizers that serve different purposes. For example, to \n  address the cause and effect, the fishbone diagram and problem and \n  solution map are the perfect organizer. In addition, the web graphic \n  organizer helps students with classifying; the Venn diagram helps \n  students compare and contrast; the word web is used for describing, and \n  the flowchart cycle is used for sequencing. Second, *retaining and recalling information* requires note-taking strategies. There are several note-taking study \n  skills strategies such as guided notes, strategic note taking, AWARE \n  notes, and columnar formats. *Guided notes* help students guide \n  through lectures. Teachers provide outlines that contain the main idea \n  and related concepts. In addition, as information is presented, students\n  can fill in the missing content into blanks where key facts should be. *Strategic note-taking* help students take good notes. For instance, it helps students summarize and organize key points. *A.W.A.R.E* note staking strategy helps students record lectures and take notes. This strategy is arranged into five steps. *A-Arrange notes, W-Write quickly, A-Apply cues, R-Review notes, E-Edit notes.*\n  \n  Third, *organizing materials and managing time* requires\n  time management study strategy skills. Time management study skills \n  help students manage their time efficiently. For instance, it teaches \n  students how to estimate their time, schedule time, and monitor their \n  schedule. *Estimating time* helps students estimate how long it will take to complete a task. *Schedule time* helps schedule their time by using timelines. This approach will give \n  students a better idea of when to start an assignment or project. \n  Monitoring schedule allows students to create a checklist to monitor \n  what tasks have been completed. Lastly, *selecting, monitoring and using strategies* requires\n  four self-regulation study strategy skills. Self-monitoring, \n  self-instruction, goal setting, and self-reinforcement are used to help \n  students apply cognitive strategies and how to determine if they are \n  successful.\n  \n\n2. Name four self-regulation strategies and describe how each can help a student become a more independent learner.\n  \n\n- Majority of students with learning difficulties and learning \n  disabilities need strategies that will help them stay on track. Teaching\n   self-regulation strategies foster students to be actively involved in \n  their own learning. For instance, instead of teachers being responsible \n  for monitoring students academic progress, the students will be \n  responsible for monitoring their progress on their own. In addition, \n  self-regulation strategies help students select and monitor learning \n  strategies. Students who are capable of using learning strategies \n  effectively, know where and why to use a particular strategy, whereas, \n  students who do not possess the same opportunities have difficulties \n  with academic strategies. For instance, students will use ineffective \n  strategies for all academic tasks. In order to be successful, students \n  must be responsible for their own learning. To do so, students must \n  adopt self-regulation strategies. The four self-regulation strategies \n  are *self-monitoring, self instruction, goal setting, and self-reinforcement.*\n\n*Self-monitoring* strategies provide immediate feedback to \nstudents, depicts improvement, and enable students to be aware of their \nbehavior. There are several ways students can monitor their progress. \nStudents can monitor their progress by using checklists, self-monitoring\n sheets, and self-monitoring log. For example, a self-monitoring \nchecklist can be utilized for editing assignments. But, if a student is \nhaving difficulties completing tasks such as submitting homework, they \ncan use checklists that aims towards specific behavior. *Self-instruction* strategies are when students use encouraging statements that will help \nthem cope through different situations. Some situations are working \nthrough a task, coping with a difficult situation, and rewarding \nthemselves. *Goal-setting* strategies help students establish \ngoals and increase student’s attention and motivation. Short term goals \nare considered Students who have difficulty completing tasks on time. \nTeachers can help students establish short-term goals. When setting \ngoals, students should identify goals, develop and implement plans, and \nrevise goals. Self-reinforcement occurs when individuals choose \nreinforcements and rewards for reaching or exceeding a goal. \nGoal-setting are beneficial for students because it produces improvement\n in performance, and engages students in their learning.\n\n3. Imagine that you are a middle school social studies teacher. A number of\n  your students are struggling with basic study skills. You want to help \n  all of your students to become more effective learners.\n  \n  1. Choose a graphic organizer to help your students more easily see the \n    relationship between election processes in the early 1900s and today. \n    Explain why you chose this type of graphic organizer.\n\n- The graphic organizer that will help students see the relationship \n  between election processes in the early 1900s and today would be a Venn \n  diagram. A Venn diagram is an organizer that is used to show the \n  overlapping relationship between different categories, as well as, what \n  is unique to each. Some categories are events, things, and ideas. For \n  example, students will write how the two subjects are different in the \n  outer circles, and write how they are alike in the overlapping areas. \n  For example, once students complete the Venn diagram, they will see that\n   the relationship between the election process in the early 1900s and \n  today is that elections are held on November 6 and have Democratic and \n  Republican parties.\n  \n  2. Select one note-taking strategy to help your students to take effective \n    notes to study for a test. Explain why you chose this strategy.\n- The *strategic note-taking strategy* will help students take effective notes to study for a test, coupled with the *CUES strategy*.\n   First and foremost, strategic note-taking allows students to record \n  notes by clustering the main points and summarizing each point during a \n  lecture. Clustering ideas help students remember the information and \n  summarizing aids them in monitoring comprehension and storing \n  information in their long-term memory. While teaching students how to \n  effectively use strategic note-taking strategies, teachers could \n  implement the *CUES strategy.* The C (Cluster) students will \n  divide content relating to the content that is being presented. U (Use) \n  is steps that are used by students while recording points from a \n  lecture. Students will use teacher cues to help them discern important \n  information. in addition, students should be attentive to number cues. \n  For example, *“There are six types of…”* and important cues *“This strategy is important because…”.*, E (Enter) students would be reminded to enter key terms, and the S (summarize) students will summarize lecture points.\n  \n  3. You want to introduce a mnemonic strategy to help your students learn \n    the first ten elements in the periodic chart. Select the type of \n    mnemonic strategy (or combination of strategies) you would use for this \n    task and explain why you chose it. Show how you would apply this \n    strategy for teaching the first ten elements of the periodic chart.\n- Science, engineering, and math classes can be challenging and require a \n  lot of time to study the formulas and concepts. But, once students \n  become familiar with them, they will be successful in the classroom. One\n   method for remembering a large amount of information is the use of \n  mnemonics. Also, it is effective in different grade levels, content \n  areas, and different settings. The 1st letter strategy mnemonic strategy will be used to help students learn the first ten elements in the periodic chart. The 1st letter strategy helps students remember information. In addition, this \n  mnemonic strategy instruction is effective with students with learning \n  disabilities. The two methods of teaching the 1st letter strategy are acronyms and acrostic. An *acronym* is a word whose individual letter represents the first letter of each word, whereas, an *acrostic* is a phrase that uses the first letter of each word that represents the\n   first letter of information. In light of this case, the acrostic \n  strategy is most effective. The acrostic strategy is beneficial for \n  students because it helps them recall lists of information. For example,\n   Science: The elements of the periodic table (*H-hydrogen, HE-Helium, LI-Lithium, BE-Beryllium, B-Boron, C-Carbon, N-Nitrogen, O-Oxygen, F-Fluorine, and N-Neon).* *<u>H</u>oney, <u>H</u>elps, <u>Li</u>ttle, <u>B</u>ees, <u>B</u>ring, <u>C</u>ountless, <u>N</u>ibbles, <u>O</u>f, <u>F</u>un, <u>N</u>icely.* This mnemonic strategy will help students memorize the names, symbols and the positions of the elements of the periodic table.\n  \n  4. Imagine that you are a high school teacher. You have noticed that \n    several of your students have difficulty completing their homework on \n    time. One strategy that might be helpful for these students is A-WATCH. \n    Using what you have learned in this module, explain why this strategy \n    might be effective.\n- *The acronym A-WATCH stands for, A- Assignment notebook, W-write down\n   the assignment and due date, A- ask for clarification on the \n  assignment, T-task-analyze the assignment, C-check work for errors, \n  accuracy, and neatness, H- hand in the assignment.* The A-WATCH \n  strategy might be an effective strategy because it can be considered a \n  self-management strategy. For instance, this strategy can be proven \n  effective for students with learning disabilities who have difficulty \n  completing tasks individually. Also, the A-WTCH strategy will teach \n  students with learning disabilities self-instruction, how to achieve and\n   set goals, and evaluate their work. Students are more likely to become \n  successful in completing long-term assignments if they organize how they\n   will approach them and plan accordingl*y.* In addition, this \n  strategy can help student’s complete assignments efficiently, especially\n   long-term assignments. Long-term assignments are typically due in \n  several days or weeks and include projects and book reports. The A-WATCH\n   strategy can be used to help student’s complete academic assignments \n  accurately by helping them plan and organize their assignments.\n  \n\n#### Wrap up\n\nStudents with learning disabilities struggle academically. One main \nreason why students struggle is due to deficits in executive functions, \nthe mental processes that control activities related to learning. The \nactivities that are related to learning are *Processing information, \nRetaining and Recalling Information, Organizing Materials and Time, and \nUsing Effective Learning and Study Strategies.* Due to the deficits \nin executive function processes, it is imperative that students should \nbe taught explicitly how to approach academic tasks. In addition, \nstudents need to be taught study strategy skills. There are several \nstudy skills strategies that can help students who struggle with \nexecutive functions or activities related to learning. When it comes to *Processing Information,* students can use graphic organizers. Graphic organizers help students process information easily. *Retaining and Recalling Information,* a note-taking study strategy skill helps students understand \ninformation that is presented, organize information and become actively \nengaged with the content. In addition, mnemonics is another study \nstrategy skill that corresponds with retaining and recalling \ninformation. Mnemonic strategies are presented in the form of visual and\n auditory clues that help students make meaningful connections between \nprior knowledge and new information. *Organizing Materials and managing* time consists of the organization of materials and time management. \nOrganizing materials keep students organized. For example, being \norganized help students keep their personal belongings such as their \ndesks, lockers, and book bags. Practicing this skill will foster success\n and reduce frustration. Time-management is important because it helps \nstudents manage their time effectively. In addition, it helps students \nestimate time, schedule time, and monitor schedules. Last but not least,\n *Selecting, Monitoring, and Using Strategies* consist of \nself-regulation study strategies. Self-regulation strategies help \nstudents to utilize learning strategies. There are four self-regulation \nstrategies that will help students become an active member of their \nlearning such as self-monitoring, self-instruction, goal-setting, and \nself-reinforcement. Each of these strategies can be used separately or \ntogether. For example, if a student is not making adequate progress, she\n could ask herself *why* and talk herself through the problem. \nTherefore, it is important to teach study strategy skills strategies to \nstudents, especially to students with learning disabilities.","date":1614746880000,"_id":"PK8tpiVJoiqxHmtH"}

However, evidence throughout the novel hints \nat the flaws in his statements. In J.D Salinger’s *The Catcher In The Rye* Holden displays his unreliability as a narrator through his unstable \nmentality and hypocritical actions which put into question the accuracy \nof Holden’s views on society.\n\n First of all, the most basic facts about Holden’s mentality should be \nbrought to light. The most clear cut information on his instability \ncomes from Holden himself. At the end of the book Holden’s admits that \nhe has been admitted into a mental institution and that he has yet to be\n let out. However, even before this straightforward revelation, his \nfragile mentality was demonstrated during his walk down fifth avenue \nwhere he almost suffered a nervous breakdown. More subtly hidden was the\n author’s use of phrases throughout the book. Holden is quite excessive \nin his use of his catchphrases of that “killed me” and “crazy” which he \nuses to subconsciously display his inner turmoil.\n\n This mental unstability of Holden’s stretches deeper than the surface. \nThe one event that impacted Holden’s life the most, and the one that he \nconstantly refers back to is the death of his brother, Allie. Allie’s \ndeath is a major cause to Holden psychosis. He is traumatized by this \nevent and it causes him to be burdened by guilt. As Peter Shaw stated in\n his article *Love and Death in The Catcher In The Rye* “The most\n striking double entendres, redolent both of guilt over Allie’s death \nand an attempt to fob off that guilt on someone else is a remark about \nhis sister Phoebe containing the words, ‘she killed Allie, too’…. his \nunconscious understanding is that Phoebe (like himself) is somehow \nresponsible for Allie’s death (Shaw 1-2)” He attempts to rub his guilt \noff on others but it still left with a sense of hatred towards himself \nas well as the people around him for his brothers death. This manifested\n in him a biased hatred towards the world that couldn’t save his beloved\n brother Allie. The trauma that Holden experienced also arose in him a \ndesire for death. In the scene where Phoebe asked Holden to name \nsomething that he liked he had trouble thinking of an answer. Instead, \nhe found his mind wandering to memories of James Castle, a student he \nhad known who had committed suicide. This scene suggests that Holden \nclearly has a fascination with death. Another mentionable moment is when\n he went to visit the museum. In the tomb exhibit he stated that he \n“liked it” there and that “it was so nice and peaceful.” This \ncombination of guilt and desire for death warp his views into biased \nones. His guilt, constant throughout the story, and his desire for \ndeath, perhaps as punishment for Allie’s death, prohibit Holden from \nseeing the world in a positive way. His views on society are negatively \nbiased and he refuses to see any good in society at the risk of moving \non from his guilt and seeing the world through clearer eyes.\n\n The thing that Holden hates most in society are adults. This has much \nto do with his childhood experiences which also led to his current \nwarped mentality. Holden reveals to the audience that he had a “lousy \nchildhood” and that “[his] parents were occupied and all before they had\n [him].” This already suggests that growing up Holden did not have good \nexperiences which made biased his views towards adults. When further \ndiscussing his parents Holden chooses selective information to reveal to\n the reader. He describes his parents as distant and even criticizes his\n father’s profession as a lawyer as “phony” even though there really \nisn’t anything “phony” about being a lawyer. Holden demonstrates further\n issues with his parents in that of failed affection. In the scene where\n Holden was sneaking out of his parents apartment after talking to \nPhoebe, Holden comments “I didn’t give a damn anymore if they caught \nme…I almost wished they did, in a way (Salinger).” Holden wants to be \ncaught by his parents and to be comforted, however his parents fail to \nbe there for him. In addition, when fooling around with Stradlater he \ncomments “Mother darling everything’s getting so dark in here….mother \ndarling, give me your hand, why won’t you give me your hand. \n(Salinger)”. Although he says this jokingly this statement connects \ndeeper to his parental issues. The most major event during the story \nthat shows Holden’s problem with childhood is during his walk down \nBroadway. Holden comments on a boy walking down the street with his \nfamily:\n\n[They] were just walking along, talking, not paying attention to their \nkid… He was singing that song ‘If a body catch a body coming through the\n rye’… The cars zoomed by, brakes screeched all over the place, his \nparents paid no attention to him, and he kept on walking next to the \ncurb and singing… It made me feel better. It made me feel not so \ndepressed any more (Salinger).\n\nIt was this moment that inspired Holden to want to become the catcher in\n the rye after witnessing a moment so alike his own childhood through \nseemingly careless parents. He wishes that someone would come and save \nhim from the perilous situation he is currently in and likewise wishes \nto do the same for other children. This moment also further fuels his \nidea that adults are bad although in truth, not all adults behave in \nthat careless manner.\n\n A major issue when reading the story is determining whether Holden’s \nviews are reliable enough to be trusted, mentality set aside. Holden’s \nviews in general are simply problematic. In Susan K. Mitchell’s article *To Tell You the Truth…,* Susan\n mentions two types of perceptions. Readerly and writerly. Readerly \nrefers to perceiving information in a straightforward manner while \nwriterly refers to perceiving the text in a way that is deeper than the \napparent meaning. Mitchell states that “Holden perceives reality \nreaderly, seeing only the surface differences between people, not the \nunderlying differences within each person (Mitchell 2-3).” Holden looks \ndown on others for being phony but he doesn’t seem to realize that a \nperson is more than who they appear to be. He only sees the actions of \nthe people around him rather than the motive behind them. To add to his \nflawed way of thinking is his idea that children equal innocence. Just \nas Holden cannot accurately categorize all adults as corrupt he cannot \ncategorize all children as innocent. This is clearly demonstrated by his\n younger sister Phoebe. Phoebe displays wisdom beyond her years. She \nsees through Holden’s false statements and even lies to her mother about\n smoking a cigarette even though it had actually been Holden. Although \nHolden fails to accurately perceive reality, his basic way of thinking \nis not necessarily wrong but rather unreliable. His way of thinking is \ndifferent than that of socially accepted views, the like of which he \ncalls “phony” and causes him to view “normal’ situations biasedly. Just \nlike how thinking differently from society he is considered mad, he also\n considers society’s norms as crazy and seeing their obliviousness to it\n makes him depressed (4-2). Holden is not technically wrong but his way \nof thinking is like that of me versus everyone else. In this way, his \nway of thinking is flawed as he sees “normal” people as degrading \nbecause of their conforming natures. Just because Holden has different \nviews on society doesn’t mean that those who disagree with them are \nphony. His way of thinking causes bias towards everyone and therefore \nmakes his claims unreliable.\n\n To add further to proof against his reliability, is his habit to lie to\n both others and to himself. An unreliable narrator is defined as a \nnarrator that does not follow the author’s norms as shown depicted \nthrough the novel. Holden sets the norm by repeatedly identifying \nsociety as phony and yet he constantly breaks this by lying to himself \n(Mitchell 2-1). Holden is often contradictory in his actions compared to\n how he says he feels. While he says that movies are phony he still goes\n to see many of them and knows them well enough to act them out. He even\n invites Ackley, a fellow student he dislikes to see one. He expresses \nhis hatred for the Lunts and yet still invites Sally, an old friend who \nhe has classified as phony, on a date to the Lunts. He hates “phony” \nconversations and yet has many “phony” conversations of his own. He \nclearly displays a need to be connected with people although he often \nfeels dislike towards the people he surrounds himself with. His need for\n attention causes him to act against his own norms and therefore makes \nhim an unreliable hypocrite. \n\nAside from completely ignoring his principles, he also tends to distort \nreality and subconsciously lies. Duane Edwards, in his article *Holden As The Unreliable Narrator* mentions how “[Holden] isn’t even able to quote accurately the one line\n he heard a small boy recite; …Holden changes the word ‘meet’ to ‘catch’\n and talks about not of love(the original meaning behind the poem) but \nof potential death(falling off a cliff), he reveals his willingness to \ndistort the truth by ignoring – or even changing – the facts (3-2) .” \nHolden often acts like a phony himself without even being aware of it. \nHolden also partially lies to himself when he is talking about how he \nleft his fencing gear on the subway and refuses to take responsibility \nfor his actions by adding at the end of his admittance that it “It \nwasn’t all my fault.” He can barely tell the difference between a lie \nand a truth at times such as on his date with Sally when he told her he \nloved her and yet stated right afterwards “It was a lie of course, but \nthe thing is, I meant it when I said it.” The phrase “to tell you the \ntruth” follows many of his inner statements. This leaves the reader \nwondering if this implies that he was previously lying.\n\n Not only does Holden lie to himself but to others as well. In one \nscene, Holden has a conversation on a train with one of his classmates \nmother. Holden first lies about his name and then tells the mother that \nher son is a great student who is quite popular while in actuality, \nHolden knows that it is a complete lie and rather the opposite is true. \nThroughout the book, Holden also attempts to seem older than his actual \nage. At one point, he calls up a girl on the phone to invite her out. He\n deepens his voice in order to try to sound older than he actually is \nand later also admits that he looks older than his actual age and he \nuses this in order to try to get drinks even though he is underage. He \neven lied to his sister Phoebe about getting kicked out of school in \norder to avoid upsetting her. This is not the only time he acted falsely\n in order to gain the favor of others however, even if it’s the \nattention of people he dislikes. He straight out admits that “I’m the \nmost terrific liar you ever saw in your life (Salinger 5-3).”\n\n Overall, Holden is an unreliable narrator through his unstable \nmentality caused by childhood issues and Allies death as well as through\n his hypocritical actions, lies, and problematic views. Although Holden \nseems to be telling the truth, what he believes to be true is not \nnecessarily true. When reading J.D Salinger’s, *The Catcher In The Rye,* one has to be careful to determine the accuracy of  Holden statements \nas many of his points, although seeming logically sound, are actually \nquite irrational.","date":1614831480000,"_id":"To5vDJBJD3QjWxpr"}

There are several definitions of globalization however...","featured":0,"tags":"general education essay"},"content":"Globalization brings many changes to people’s lives all over the \nworld. There are several definitions of globalization however the \nMerriam-Webster meaning is as follows. Globalization is the process by \nwhich businesses and other organizations develop international influence\n or start operating on an international scale. From shifting social \nnorms around the globe to changing how countries do business, \ntechnological advances, and intensifying competition in the workforce, \nas well as, the educational field; effects of globalization are \neverywhere and far reaching (Carnoy, 2002).\n\nGlobalization effects education all over the world. For example, due \nto intricate technological advances many jobs have been digitized. This \nmeans that the skill set that’s required for jobs have changed \ndramatically. Subsequently, jobs that could once be sustained by someone\n with a high school diploma or less have disappeared. These global and \neconomic changes cause shifts in the job market and are essentially \nchanging what is needed from the education system. We now need to \nprepare students for jobs that require different skill sets. Employees \nmust now be knowledgeable on foreign languages, cultures, and overall \nway of business to be successful in their career. For the most part the \nUnited States has been a leader in education compared to other \ncountries. Being the first country to achieve mass collegiate education,\n the United States of America always had the highest number of qualified\n people in its labor force. This is how the American economy was able to\n thrive and take advantage of the global market. But does this \nglobalization led to development or division in education? (Welch & \nMok, 2003) Well, in recent years countries around the world have \nrefocused on expanding education, many of the smaller, more impoverished\n countries actually working *together* to do so. Since graduating\n high school is now the standard in most countries, many are now setting\n goals to increase the number of college attendees even working with the\n United Nations to provide education for all countries! Although the \nUnited States has a greater number of older workers that are well \neducated, many other countries have a greater number of young workers \nwith college degrees. Nonetheless, with more high school graduates \nchasing college degrees and older people pursuing higher education after\n so many years of being out of school; this is changing too. People of \nall ages are pursuing higher education all over the world and with \neducation standards changing as well, we are truly living in an era like\n never before. We are all preparing for an interconnected world that \nglobalization has brought to us and education is just one small stepping\n stone for the high skill economy of the future (Young 1998, Brown et \nal. 2001).\n\nThe growing importance of education is more than wanting our \ncitizens to be smart. Countries are wanting their citizens to get \neducated in order to build for a future in which we are one global \ncitizen class that works together economically and otherwise to grow our\n countries. This can help with foreign policy and international business\n transactions and trades. To be knowledgeable of a certain country is to\n be more accepting and understanding of said countries culture and \nbeliefs. Appearing welcoming and friendly to different cultures will \nattract investments from foreign countries. This will boost the \ncountry’s economy (see OECD 1998, Campbell 2000). With a larger economy a\n countries revenue with increase and strengthen the country (ideally). \nThis is another reason why the quality of education is so important.\n\nWhile education systems all over the world are working on \nimproving and developing new ways to teach people; there is another way \npeople are gaining more and more knowledge in today society. The \ninternet. Not only is the use of computers and the internet now more \ncommon in the classroom it has also grown more common in everyday life \n(Martin Carnoy, 1999, pp.15-17). By using the internet society has \naccess to different kinds of information instantaneously. This makes \ngaining knowledge for students as well as non-students easier and faster\n than ever before. This is great when used as a means for students \nstruggling to comprehend course material or certain concepts, but with \nsuch a wide variety of information available, and it is important \nlearners are able to distinguish between dependable and untrustworthy \nresources. However for countries such as China or Iran who have limited \nto no access online; this can make a learning different concepts or \ngaining certain knowledge difficult because their governments often \nblock or edit information. Therefore citizens of those countries or \ncountries similar may actually have a skewed since of the truth because \nnot *all* information is given to them. In a way this widens the \ngap between the education progress of a developed country and an \nunderdeveloped country/country who may be banned from viewing certain \nmaterial. With technological advances making their way all around the \nglobe (globalization), eventually all countries will have access to any \ninformation they desire.\n\nGlobalization is a powerful and important process that influences\n economies, education systems, politics, and even social customs. With a\n growing sense of oneness; or “we are all global citizens in one world” \noutlooks, globalizations *positive* and increasing impact on education and societies growing desire to become more educated is obvious.","date":1618367880000,"_id":"UZALH5IXhhTImnEX"}

The article ‘Pedagogical techniques and\n student outcomes in applied instrumental lessons taught by experienced \nand pre-service American music teachers’ by Henninger, Flowers and \nCouncill highlights the importance of employing effective and versatile \neducational techniques, where they encourage further training into \nteachers to providing the best experience for music students. They \ncompare teaching traits such as methods of explanation and teaching \nstyles such as application and engagement. Junda’s article ‘Developing \nReadiness for Music Readiness’ builds on the notion of employing \neffective and purposeful teaching methods by emphasising the importance \non student’s ability to utilise their voices. She explains the potential\n detrimental effects of achieving future musical pursuits without \nproviding students with foundational skills in the classroom where she \naddresses some valuable and engaging musical activities that educators \ncan implement within the classroom to combat this issue. Alongside \nproviding students with knowledge of musical fundamentals, another \naspect of effective classroom music teaching is educating the student’s \nsocial scope. McClung in his article ‘Extramusical Skills in the Music \nClassroom’ expresses the need of developing these aspects in young \nchildren into the musical classroom, rather than a concentration on only\n the music academia. As a possible future secondary teacher, this \nresearch on the different educational approaches has provided me with an\n insight with aspects I should take on board into my future classroom as\n well as methods in which I can approach learning throughout my studies \nand beyond.\n\nThe authors of this article base their research and findings on works \nincluding ‘Measure of instructional effectiveness in music research’ by \nR. A. Duke where learning outcomes can be better addressed through \nfurther improvement of educational methods. Also, Thomas W. Goolsby’s article ‘Time Use in Instrument Rehearsals: A\n Comparison of Experienced, Novice, and Student Teachers’ findings \nindicated that music educators with more experience tended to conduct \ntheir sessions more proficiently, using a range of techniques which \nallows a greater musical experience by student. Continued research and growth of effective teaching techniques for \naspiring educators is beneficial to yield improvements in the quality \nand effectiveness in the music classroom. The writers of this article \nencourage further research into training and mentoring music educators \nto promote efficient skills to improve the learning experience of \nstudent musicians. They express concern regarding the teaching where a \npredominant focus of repetitive and somewhat monotonous learning was the\n methodology used by teachers of the less-experienced calibre. The student’s musical experience in the lesson seemed to be impacted by\n an overuse of criticism with a somewhat inappropriate proportioning of \ntime between critiquing and student practical involvement, which affects\n the student being able to reach their potential. The amounts of \nnegativity used by educators compared to words of praise and \nencouragement is unreasonably high. There are a range of strategies implied to address this matter, \nincluding the use of practical hands-on explanations where “modeling \nactivities had a significance improved ear-to-hand coordination.” The rationale and reasoning should be included as part of teaching the material, alongside addressing the conceptual skill. A musical experiment of attempting to teach ‘Mary had a Little Lamb’ \nfrom both experienced and less-experienced educators indicated a more \nactive verbal student participation, likely resulting from uses of \neffective remarks from them. The purpose of discussing this experiment is to highlight the benefits \nand outcomes to music students of utilising effective and purposeful \npedagogical techniques which should be taught to music teachers. The \nexploration and experiment involved in the article suggests a need to \nimplement good teaching habbits by teachers to raise the quality and \nconfidence of the performance and learning experience by music students.\n Henninger’s later article ‘The Effects of Performance Quality Ratings \non Perceptions of Instrumental Music Lessons’ investigated further into \nthe types of scrutiny of teachers of the less-experience calibre\n\nRutkowsi’s article ‘The Measurement and Evaluation of Children’s Singing\n Voice Development’ expresses concern over the lack of success in \nlearning and perplexing in music is caused by the inability to use the \nsinging voice as a tool. If a larger emphasis is placed on educating and enhancing students \nunderstand of music fundamentals at an early age in the school \nclassroom, the issue of unable to fully develop musically can be better \naddressed. Junda writes this article to address the necessity of \nfundamental music training in the school classroom in order for young \nstudents to engage musically in more difficult activities. The ability \nto recognise and interpret music notation and participate in more \nadvanced musical tasks is hindered without successful mastery of a solid\n understanding of music basics. Although educators may be introducing \nmusical material to students of a young age, their full potential may \nnot be unlocked without implementing some changes to their teaching \nmethodology. There are a range of teaching strategies and tools that \neducators can utilise within the music classroom to address this. \nStudents can be introduced to basic and engaging activities using their \nsinging voice to a range of activities. An engaging activity is for students to use their voices as \nonomatopoeia for real-life sounds. Educators should monitor their \nprogression and provide constructive feedback to the students such as \nasking them to imitate a range notes and pitches to test their vocal \nability. This coupled with peer reviewing is also encouraged. Furthermore, students can be trained to distinguish between different \nmelodic patterns and note registers by practising with interpreting \nintervals.[[12]](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/teaching/pedagogical-methods-for-teaching-music.php#_ftn12) The concept of duration should also be introduced by activities such as “clap the rhythm”.\n The utilisation of these elementary activities means that students have\n a more sophisicated groundwork of the music fundamentals which they can\n use aboard in more difficult musical tasks. The ability to recognise \nnotation can be more successful after grappling and achievement of these\n classroom tasks. The exploration of this article highlgihts the \nvitalness of training and mastery of the foundational skills within not \nonly the music classroom, prior to the exposure of higher-order tasks. \nThe article ‘Part Singing Revisited’ by Junda mentions students can have\n the ability to sing more advanced and demanding type singing \nactivities, given they are equipped and trained with the foundational \nskills needed.\n\nWriter McClung’s article refers to the works of William E. Fredrickson \n‘Social influence and Effects on Student Perception and Participation in\n Music’ where a valuable experience such as the exposure with music \nparticipation at a young age can unlock various positive and provocative\n memories.[[15]](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/teaching/pedagogical-methods-for-teaching-music.php#_ftn15) Daniel Goleman ‘Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ’\n article highlights the importance of the development of an emotional \naspect in children referred to as “Emotional Quotient”. In order to train and learn these importance skills, a positive and \nencouraging environment is needed as such a musical space is used. \nMcClung expresses concern over the lack of catering and development of \nvarious aspects of student’s cognitive and emotional attributes where \nthis can be better addressed in the parameters of a music-orientated \nclassroom. These emotional aspects cannot be fully dealt with and \nmentored with a mainly Intelligence-focused school curriculum, which may\n impact the students to maintain an appropriate level of mental \nhealthiness and the ability to communicate their psychological and \nsocial needs.[[17]](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/teaching/pedagogical-methods-for-teaching-music.php#_ftn17) The arising issue cannot be overcome and dealt without a drastic change as “those who lack the skills necessary…is growing”.\n There are couple of strategies that are adopted by schools to combat \nthis including the introducing and utilisation of “Extramusical Skills”.\n This could include the use of programs such as the school choir where \nstudent’s response to aspects such as “integrative associations, \ncommunicative emotions” had seen an improvement and these attributes were seen as of value. \nAlso, a greater emphasis on integrating the Emotional Quotient component\n into the confines of the music classroom such as practising peer \nbonding and socialising should also be beneficial for children. The \nmastery of these types of behaviours can be effectively taught by \nincorporating each of these behavioural elements into certain learning \noutcomes of the music classroom and to create positive and motivating \nclassroom activities for the students to put into practice alongside \nteaching the material. McClung suggests these changes to be put in place in schools as to \naddress the previous concerns of the neglect of the Emotional Quotient \ntraining in students where these aspects can be trained in a \nmusic-orientated space where Fredrickson mentions memoriable expeirences\n can be experienced by a child. After implementing these adjustments to \nthe delivery of syllabus material to the music classroom, these \npsychological factors in students can now be addressed in pupils which \ncan ultimately leads to commendable results of a successful academic \nexperience of both the Emotional and Intelligence Quotient. McClung’s exploration of this has allowed teachers to challenge and \ntheir methods of teaching and to ensure that the social aspect of \nstudents is better addressed in their classroom. His article ‘Using \nVideo Self-Assessment to Enhance Nonverbal Conducting Gesture’ \nhighlights the importance of effective conducting techniques, a \ncommunicative behaviour which can be used effectively in a musical \nsetting, likewise with the training of social skills.\n\nThe research that I have gathered and learnt throughout has provided me \nwith innovative approaches to learning and attributes which I can \nutilise in not only my future studies at the university, but in \naddition, as an aspiring high school teacher. As a contemporary music \nstudent, one of the skills involved in music production is the ability \nto be proficient at utilising a DAW such as Logic Pro X. The mastery of \nthis software may take some time and practise. As the second articles \nhighlights the need for a well-developed foundational base, one of the \nunits of study which I will undertake in Semester 2 is called ‘Creative \nMusic Technology’, where I hope to continue to develop and hone in my \nbasic DAW skills, prior to pursing more advanced and higher-level \nmusical projects in the future. In addition with one of the music skills\n units ‘Fundamentals of Music 3’, it will be beneficial for my learning \nif I revise needed material from ‘Fundamentals of Music 2’ as some of \nthe new content learnt may be expanded on from the latter course which I\n completed this semester. Furthermore, as an aspiring secondary music or\n mathematics teacher, I value the importance of equipping students with \nrudimentary skills prior to introducing harder concepts. For example, \nthe concept of duration can be introduced by asking students to clap \nalong to nursery rhymes such as ‘Humpty Dumpty’ and ‘The Grand Old Duke \nof York’ as I play it on the piano to identify the rhythm, prior to \nwriting the meter. In relation to the first article, employing \npurposeful teaching methodology and to focus on the rationale rather \nthan a somewhat ineffective memorising exercise, I hope to provide a \npurposeful and hands-on learning experience for my future students, \nincluding the ‘why?’ in my explanations to hopefully engage my students \nin the classroom. For example, when introducing a formula, I try to \nprovide students with a derivation of the formula, rather than just \ncompleting questions. Monitoring and recording my student’s progress is \nessential in their academic development. Finally, in terms of the third \narticle, addressing the social and behavioural aspects of students in \nthe classroom is necessary to promote aspects such as communication and \ninteraction between my students.","date":1614923520000,"_id":"V9XmdhsDHwPuwbT0"}

With delivery times taken into account, \ncompletely producing a product from beginning to end could easily take a\n year.\n\n#### Cost\n\n3D printing is the most cost-effective manufacturing method for \nlimited production runs and applications. Traditional prototyping \nmethods such as CNC machining and injection molding needed a large \nnumber of costly machines, as well as a high level of labor, as they \nrequire skilled machine operators and technicians to operate them.\n\n#### On-Demand Printing\n\nAnother benefit of print on demand is that, unlike conventional \nmanufacturing methods, it does not need a lot of room to store \ninventory. This saves both space and money because there is no need to \nprint in bulk unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\n#### Parts that are both strong and light\n\nPlastic is the most commonly used 3D printing material, but certain \nmetals can also be used. Plastics, on the other hand, have the advantage\n of being lighter than their metal counterparts. This is especially \nrelevant in industries like automotive and aerospace, where \nlight-weighting is a concern and higher fuel efficiency can be achieved.\n\n#### Value For Money\n\nTraditional manufacturing methods can lead to shoddy designs and, as a\n result, shoddy prototypes. Consider baking a cake, in which all of the \ningredients are combined and mixed together before being baked. If the \ningredients were not properly combined, the cake would have issues such \nas air bubbles or failing to bake thoroughly. The same thing can happen \nby using subtractive or injection techniques; consistency isn't always \nguaranteed.\n\n#### Quality \n\nTraditional manufacturing methods can lead to subpar prototypes due \nto poor design. Consider baking a cake, in which all of the ingredients \nare combined and mixed before being baked. If the ingredients aren't \nthoroughly combined, the cake can develop air bubbles or fail to bake \nthoroughly. Similarly, accuracy is not always guaranteed by using \nsubtractive or injection methods.\n\n#### Environmentally friendly\n\nThis method is inherently environmentally friendly because it reduces\n the amount of material waste. When you consider factors like improved \nfuel efficiency from using lightweight 3D printed parts, the \nenvironmental benefits become even greater.\n\n#### Risk Reduction  \n\nBecause of the advantages of Quality and Consistency described above, [3D printing](https://techbizland.com/benefits-of-3d-printing-technology/) helps a company to reduce its manufacturing risks. Product designers \nmay use 3D printing technology to test product prototypes before making \nlarge-scale production investments that could be disastrous.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n3D printing has amazing benefits in the modern world. You can even \ncreate a large house with the help of 3D printing. 3D is just the \nbeginning and you must know that 4D printing is also on its way!!","date":1615256820000,"_id":"fckjOCHPkx4f2Go8"}

It is structured by rules of procedure.","featured":0,"tags":"law civil essay"},"content":"![Head Image](/assets/discover.svg)\n#### When does discovery happen in a lawsuit\n\nIn a civil suit the parties must gather their own evidence through the \nstructured process of discovery.  Those involved in a civil suit are \ncalled a party because they can be individuals or business entities. \nBecause most parties store data electronically the process of discovery \nrelating to that data is not surprisingly called eDiscovery.\n\nIn a criminal case the authorities often investigate and secure evidence \nbefore charging someone with a crime. In contrast a party might file its\n civil lawsuit based only on a good faith belief of the actions of the \nother side. They then have to use discovery to gather the evidence to \nprove their case. The rules of civil procedure give structure to the \ndiscovery process. The rules of evidence and lend guidance and help \nlimit discovery. This is, of course an oversimplification of the process but you get the idea.\n\n#### What can I ask for in discovery and how\n\nIn a civil suit each party can ask the other side for documents and \ninformation.  Documents are obtained through Requests to Produce. These \nrequests also reach electronically stored information or ESI. Other \ninformation can be obtained through written questions called \nInterrogatories or orally through a deposition or both. Parties can also\n verify certain facts by asking the other side to admit them in Requests\n for Admissions.\n\n#### Can I ask someone outside the lawsuit for documents\n\nIn some cases the party holding key information may not be part of the \nlawsuit.  Discovery can be obtained from these non-parties or third \nparties through a deposition or document request without a deposition. \nBut Interrogatories and Requests for Admissions cannot be used with a \nthird party. Those may only be directed to another party in a lawsuit. \n\n#### How does discovery actually work\n\nDiscovery takes time to complete. Large blocks of time are purposely \nbuilt into our discovery rules. This is Sometimes why lawsuits take so \nlong. But I believe the time intentionally injected into discovery \nallows the parties to gain perspective over the dispute. That time also \nallows cooler heads to prevail as the saying goes.  \nAfter sending a discovery request to another party you normally have to wait at least\n 30 days for a response. This can even be longer depending on the \ncircumstances. Discovery requests may also require the intervention of \nthe judge. That can delay the process as you wait for a hearing date. It\n can also increase the expenses of the lawsuit.","date":1615634940000,"_id":"tHsOPjen0ln4yb8W"}

In this blog, we will share with you 10 tips to score higher marks in UGC NET Paper I.","featured":0,"tags":"nta-net exam tips"},"content":"![head-image](/assets/art2.svg)\nHello future professors,\n\nGreetings from Ourclass !\n\nIn this blog, we will share with you 10 tips to score higher marks in UGC NET Paper I.\n\n#### Introduction\nClearing the UGC NET exam is a tough task for many aspirants. Most people fail in the exam because of lack of proper guidance and orientation. Being an objective test, it is very easy to score higher marks in UGC NET if the aspirant follows a proper strategy. \n\nIt is not an issue for most of the aspirants to score decent marks in Paper II as they have studied it or have been studying it in their post-graduation. But, Paper I gives tough luck to many. A lot of aspirants could only score less than 50 percent for Paper I, and most of the other aspirants score lesser marks for Paper I when compared with Paper II. Even some of the NET qualified candidates fail to reach the JRF benchmark score due to low marks in Paper I\n\nIt is a popular disbelief that Paper I is tough as it contains those topics which a typical aspirant doesn’t pay much attention to. Most aspirants  from the Arts and Humanities stream have that inherent dislike towards General Knowledge, Quantitative Aptitude and Reasoning. \n\nThey believe scoring good marks in these subjects is a Herculean task and give up Paper I preparations fully thinking it is not their cup of tea. But, the fact is that Paper I, if you score better in it, can be the gamechanger of your career. Since everyone prepares for Paper II, there won’t be much difference in it’s marks between different aspirants. But, if you are able to get a few more questions in Paper I right, it will bring a huge change in your total marks, ultimately hitting the NET or JRF benchmark. \n\nIn this blog, we will give you 10 tips to score higher marks in Paper I so that clearing NET or JRF will be a lot easier for you. \n\n#### Tip 1 - Understand the Syllabus:\nPaper I syllabus contains 10 Units and UGC has clearly given the different subtopics under each one of them in their website. UGC won’t deviate from what is given in the syllabus and there will be five questions each from these 10 Units, with 2 marks for each question, that is, a total of 50 questions worth 100 marks. \n\nFor easier comparison, we have divided the syllabus into 3 broad areas - General Awareness, Quantitative Aptitude and Reasoning, and Teaching and Research Orientation. General Awareness comprises ICT, Environment and Higher Education. Quantitative Aptitude and Reasoning include those subjects that involve numbers, problem solving and critical thinking such as Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation. Teaching and Research Orientation include Teaching Aptitude, Research Aptitude and Communication. We did not include Comprehension under any of them as it is an easy bite for all the aspirants to get 5 out of 5.\n\n#### Tip 2 - Solving Previous Year Question Papers:\nThis is an important task every aspirant should follow. But, aspirants rarely go through Previous Year Questions or other Practice Questions such as Mock Tests from coaching institutes. Solving Previous Questions has two fold benefits. Firstly, it would help you in understanding where you stand now in terms of marks and in which all subjects you have scored better. Apart from that this would also help you in understanding those specific areas or sub-topics which are UGC’s hot favorites from which they ask a lot of questions. \n\nWe will insist you to practice more of UGC’s Previous Year Questions when compared with Practice Questions from Coaching Institutes as the people who are putting questions for UGC have a similar mentality and similar interests, and there are chances that these questions may repeat exactly as they are or in a different form.\n\n#### Tip 3 - Understand Your Past Mistakes:\nIf you are not a newbie to UGC NET, it is important that you must critically evaluate your mistakes in the previous attempts. These might include not giving enough importance to Paper I preparations, reaching the examination hall late, spending too much time on any topic, not attempting all the questions etc. If you get an idea about what all things have gone wrong in the past attempts, it helps in you creating a new strategy which is free of mistakes. \n\nIf you are a newbie on the other hand, don’t make the mistakes your seniors or friends have made. Get advice from those around you regarding where you can make mistakes, so that you yourself won’t make one.\n\n#### Tip 4 - Know Your Interests:\nEvery aspirant should be able to know their areas of interests from the topics covered in the syllabus. You might have got a brief idea about your areas of interest from solving previous questions. You also have to self introspect, i.e. understand what are your strengths and your weaknesses in attempting the Paper. \n\nFor example, some people may spend more time on Paper I in general which kills their time to perform well in Paper II, whereas some others are quick with Paper I. Some people may spend more time on math related questions and perform very badly in that, while some others may be good with numbers. Tension and stress during the exam is the biggest hurdle for some aspirants, which may not be the case with a few others.\n\nAs strengths and weaknesses are different for different people, aspirants themselves have to understand them, take note of them, remember them while preparing and attempting the exam.\n\n#### Tip 5- Learn, Learn and Learn:\nThere is no alternative to learning, and no candidate who cracked the exam would say they cleared it without learning. Learning is an ongoing process. Some people have been learning from their childhood and therefore they may not need to prepare exclusively for the exam. Others need to put extra efforts on preparing for Paper I. \n\nGetting more than 35 questions right, i.e. scoring more than 70 percent in Paper I is a deciding factor in winning JRF, and for that your knowledge base is a prerequisite. Continuous learning improves this knowledge base and learning like this would be more helpful when compared with learning for the sake of passing the exam. So, find all possible resources that would help you learn - newspapers, study materials, videos, coaching classes etc. and get started.\n\n#### Tip 6 - Revise and Remember:\nLearning does not end with reading and mugging up facts; it also includes revisiting the topics that you have covered so that you can know whether you remember them. Revision is a key component of clearing the NTA NET.\n\nYou should revise all the portions you studied till you can answer them even in your sleep. As the syllabus for the exam is not that vast like other exams and the questions are pretty predictable, you don’t need vast reading for the exam. Instead, more focussed reading and revising them will suffice for NET aspirants. \n\n#### Tip 7 - Practice More Questions:\nDoing more and more practice questions not only helps you in understanding where you stand now, but also it helps in gaining knowledge in areas which you left out while preparing. Above all, practicing questions helps the aspirant in understanding the logic and pattern of the examination. \n\nThis is an important step that should not be forgotten as every examination has its own specific pattern of asking questions and when you crack the logic of it, it becomes easier for you to score better in it. We can’t clear the UPSC Civil Services Examination with the same logic of clearing the NET examination. We will detail the steps to crack the logic of attempting UGC NET questions in a separate blog.\n\nTip 8 - Prepare a Clear Cut Strategy Before the Exam: \nStrategies win every battle, so is in the case of NET. A well drawn out strategy is as important as your preparation. You can start making your strategy from the beginning of your preparation, by culminating all the steps mentioned above - understanding the syllabus, knowing your areas of interest and past mistakes etc.\n\nA few days before the exam, you must come with a clear strategy as to how you are going to attempt the test. It can range from how much time you will spend for each paper, how you will attempt questions you have not heard of, how you will deduce the correct answer from different similar options etc.\n\n#### Tip 9 - Be Optimistic and Tension Free: \nEven if you have covered every nook and corner of the syllabus, it doesn’t guarantee you success unless you are optimistic and free of tension. Tension kills more NET dreams than lack of preparation does. \n\nAs traits related to optimism are psychological, it demands repeated efforts to make yourself optimistic and tension free. You have to make yourself believe that you will clear the exam, no matter what. You can increase your self confidence through practicing meditation, cementing the thought of clearing the test in your mind through any methods you find suitable. You can kill your stress and tension through attempting more mock tests in an environment similar to the NET examination, listening to music or watching motivational videos on Youtube etc.\n\n#### Tip 10 - Leverage and Transform: \nNow that you have understood from the above steps about your strengths, weaknesses and interests, and attained sufficient knowledge from learning, revising and solving questions, it is important that the aspirants should leverage on their knowledge and strengths, and minimise the impact of their weaknesses in the examination. For example, if you are inherently good at certain types of questions then you don’t need to spend much time on preparing that. Whereas, you can practice more questions from those units which are tougher for you. \n\nIf you find certain portions, for example math related questions, tough and you have been constantly scoring poor marks in such questions, it is better that you don’t spend much time on such questions in the examination hall. You can also otherwise select 5 or 6 areas in which you are good at, learn everything from it and attempt the test. \n\n#### Conclusion\nAs every individual is different in tastes, interests, strengths and weaknesses, it is upto the aspirant to  finally decide what they have to follow. We can and we have only given general tips for those NET aspirants who have no idea about how to score better in Paper I. It is upto you to take these tips and use them on your respective personal situations and prepare. \n\nThank you for reading this blog. If you liked it, kindly share it with your loved ones. \n\nWe wish you all the best for the coming NET.","date":1615864920000,"_id":"vs3QTJjrAHOkIkpB"}

They \nare collectively known as XR (extended reality). For most people, these \nterms are quite abstract and often perceived as the science-fiction in \nHollywood movies. But the infiltration of computer-generated objects \nalready exists in our lives, we just don’t realise as a user.\n\nYou might have tried to catch Pokemon in recent times or using \nbitmoji with the Snapchat camera. That is actually AR (Augmented \nReality). There are various other groundbreaking use cases of AR in \nseveral industries. Many tech companies and engineers around the globe \nare working to implement these technologies into business operations to \nbring efficiency.\n\n#### What is the Extended Reality (XR)?\n\nExtended Reality (XR) is an umbrella term for all the immersive \ntechnologies including Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and\n Mixed Reality (MR). All the technologies that extend reality by \nblending virtual worlds with the real or creating only virtual worlds \nare included in XR, including those technologies that are still to be \ndeveloped. [A recent survey](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/extended-reality-xr/) revealed\n that more than 60% of respondents voted for XR being the mainstream in \nthe upcoming five years. Following are the technologies included \ncurrently in the XR technologies:\n\n#### AR – What is Augmented Reality?\n\nAugmented Reality (AR) is a technology that provides a view of the \nreal-world environment with superimposed computer-generated elements \n(graphics), which ultimately changes real-world perception. In other \nwords, it is the technology that adds layers of digital information to \nthe real environment.\n\nUnlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t create a whole artificial \nsurroundings that replace the real world. AR modifies the existing \nreal-world environment with elements like sounds, motions, and graphics.\n\nThe term Augmented Reality (AR) was coined back in 1990. The initial \ncommercialisations of AR were in the television and military sector and \nthe rise of smartphones and internet connectivity has introduced a \nsecond wave, introducing AR into the common man’s life.\n\nThe technology is massively improving the manufacturing sector where \nproducts are directly projected via 3D models and fused together in \nreal-time. Also, there are many augmented reality apps that are helping \nindividuals with their health and entertainment.\n\n#### VR – What is Virtual Reality?\n\nIn almost opposition to AR, the virtual reality experience is a fully\n immersive simulated digital environment, which is experienced by the \nusers through wearable gadgets i.e. VR headsets or head-mounted \ndisplays. These VR gadgets provide users with a 360-degree view into the\n completely artificial world that literally fools the brain into \nbelieving that it is the reality.\n\nMany [tech companies and VR developers](https://www.nimbleappgenie.com/) have\n created artificial environments using VR technology, i.e. swimming \nunderwater, walking on mars, battlefield, and many more. The gaming and \nentertainment industry are the early adopters of VR technology and many \nother industries including healthcare, military, education, engineering \nare pilot testing VR for several use cases.\n\n#### MR – What is Mixed Reality?\n\nThough this technology is still in its initial stage, Microsoft has \ntested it with their product HoloLens. It allows users to place a \nvirtual digital object into the real environment (your room) and gives \nthe users an ability to move, spin or interact with that digital object.\n\nAlso known as hybrid reality, the mixed reality is where the real and\n digital world objects co-exist and can interact with each other in \nreal-time. MR technology requires very high processing power as compared\n to AR and VR. There are many tech companies that are exploring the \npossibilities where they can put MR to work.\n\n#### Top 5 AR and VR trends in 2021\n\nThe year 2019 was a golden year for technological advancements, where we saw disrupting technologies such as [AI & ML](https://www.nimbleappgenie.com/blogs/the-types-of-ai-and-the-ways-it-is-reshaping-it/),\n AR & VR, and IoT flourishing. The XR (AR & VR) technologies \nhave specifically shown their potential in the fields of gaming and \nentertainment. \n\n[IDC forecasted](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45679219) that\n the worldwide spending on XR is expected to grow with 78.5% from 2019 \nto reach $18.8 billion by the end of this year. The industry experts \nbelieve that we’ll witness a whole new load of next-gen XR powered \ngadgets that will provide users with immersion and realism of a greater \nextent. However, the industrial usage of XR has outpaced gaming and \nentertainment.\n\n#### Industrial Use of AR & VR technologies is outpacing the consumer-oriented implementations\n\nThe first interaction most people have with XR technologies is in \ngaming and entertainment. This may be the reality till now, but it won’t\n be in future as some research shows that the industry’s focus is \nshifting towards enterprise XR solution development.\n\nThe report by VR Intelligence states that 65% of AR development \ncompanies are working on building AR-powered industrial applications \nwhereas only 37% are working on consumer applications and gadgets.\n\nAlthough the recent popular implementation of XR in consumer \napplications such as Facebook’s Oculus Rift and Pokemon Go has made the \nheadlines,\n this industrial trend of XR isn’t surprising as it’s potential to boost\n productivity and ensure safety was a lucrative proposition for the \nenterprises.","date":1615521000000,"_id":"xvBVHsfzfcYEUDN7"}

In order to extend each child’s learning they support...","featured":0,"tags":"education general school"},"content":"![Head Image](/assets/child-write.png)\n#### Introduction\n\n*‘Early-years educators relate what is being taught to what children* *already know. In order to extend each child’s learning they support* *and guide children through each new stage of learning. They know* *that the abilities and attitudes that young children develop in the* *early years are an important part of a life-long journey during which* *children will need to acquire all the language skills necessary to* *interpret, manipulate, control and organize language for their own* *present and future purposes.’*\n\n(Browne 1996, vii)\n\nThe above quote neatly summarises the need to ensure that young children’s language development is fostered in the best possible way by educators. What children learn now can have a life-long impact upon how they interact with the world in future. It is the child’s teacher, who has the capacity to greatly influence how a child acquires and uses language, to assess what the child already knows, and to use this knowledge to foster and guide the child through, *‘each new stage of learning,’* (Browne 1996, vii). It was with this clear intention in mind, with which the following study was undertaken. The aim, to assess one child’s current speaking and listening, reading and writing skills, to analyse any observations carefully, and to use the information gathered as a basis for planning the child’s future learning needs. The child chosen, a female, was aged 5 years and 9 months at the time of the study and does not have any recognised special educational needs. She will, \nhenceforth, be referred to as, ‘Child A,’ for the remainder of the report.\n\n#### Reading Analysis\n\nListening to Child A read on a one-to-one basis was extremely informative. She is starting to use some expression in her voice, and is attempting to make the text sound more like natural language, however, she has little sense of phrase boundaries, and consequently, can often \nsound stilted. She regularly has to decode words on a word-by-word basis, but is not always successful in her attempts, meaning that the language does not flow. There were frequent extended pauses during the reading of each sentence. On a number of occasions Child A was unable to decode a word but had a limited number of alternative strategies \navailable to her, in order to help her to continue reading.\n\nThe miscue analyses showed that Child A’s average negative miscue rate was 8.06% for the books chosen from her particular reading ‘stage’. It is recommended that when matching a book to a reader the negative miscue rate should lie somewhere between 3% and 8%, with a miscue rate of 10% representing frustration level, (Moon et al. 1994, 116).This evidence may suggest that the text was too difficult for Child A, resulting in a negative effect on her confidence and interest.\n\nGraham and Kelly propound that*, ‘Surprising insights into children’s reading can emerge in the one-to-one conversations which you have with them,’* (Graham and Kelly 1997, 115). I talked at length with Child A and we discussed her reading habits and attitudes towards books. It quickly became obvious that Child A loves books in many forms. She confided that\n she often imagines that she is the princess in the stories which are read to her. Child A likes to look at the pictures in books and tell her own stories from these, but feels unable to read the words alone. It became clear that Child A has access to many books at home, and Mum and Dad evidently read a lot. She delighted in recounting her first experience of visiting a library, which occurred recently, and she was given ample time to choose a book to take home. Child A proudly confided that she knew the book by heart as she had read it that often. It was evident that Child A, not only enjoys reading, but also sees herself as a\n good reader.\n\nObservation of Child A during several guided reading sessions with her class teacher, presented a different picture. Child A frequently became easily distracted, and failed to focus on the text which was in front of her. She appeared to be restless and anxious to move off onto different activities. Child A was confident when attempting to read a word she thought she knew, however, when she came across an unfamiliar word she would not attempt to read it. With prompting she would begin to ‘sound’ a word out, but often gave up before completing the word. Again, Child A seems over reliant on picture cues and was attempting to tell the story from the pictures. She remained unfocused throughout each guided reading session and while other children were turning the pages of their books, Child A sat with \nher book shut. She was unable to participate in the group discussion concerning the book and was unable to relate the main points of the story to the teacher when asked.\n\nChild A was also observed during shared whole-class reading sessions. While she did not openly volunteer answers to the questions asked, she did respond once the class teacher asked her a direct question.\n\nIn consideration of the above evidence, and in conjunction with the level descriptors provided by the National Curriculum ([www.nc.uk.net](http://www.nc.uk.net/)), it is possible to suggest that Child A is working at Level One in terms of her reading:\n\n*‘Pupils recognise familiar words in simple texts. They use their* *knowledge of letters and sound-symbol relationships in order to* *read words and to establish meaning when reading aloud. In these * *activities they sometimes require support. They express their* *response to poems, stories and non-fiction by identifying aspects* *they like.’*\n\n([www.nc.uk.net](http://www.nc.uk.net/))\n\nHowever, it is clear that Child A meets only part of this level descriptor, as she is not yet using her phonic knowledge to read words, and to use the words to comprehend the story.\n\n#### Implications for Teaching and Learning: Reading\n\nIt is clear from the evidence given above that Child A is not a confident of fluent reader. She is working in the early stages of National Curriculum level 1, and will need specific support if she is to begin to work in the later stages of the level, and indeed to start to work towards National Curriculum level 2.\n\nThe problems with Child A’s use of expression and lack of awareness of phrase boundaries, could perhaps be addressed by adults modelling the reading process. Graham and Kelly suggest that this is a viable way of first introducing a book to a child, before they are given\n the opportunity to read the book for themselves, (Graham and Kelly 1997, 105). This could give Child A the confidence she needs and will expose her to the way books should be read, using lots of expression. It will also aid her awareness of phrase boundaries, particularly if the adult traces the text with their finger as they read and makes exaggerated pauses when full stops or commas are encountered.Child A’s reluctance to join in group and class discussion about books could be a result of a lack of confidence in her own abilities, or\n perhaps she is unsure of how to respond correctly and does not want to ‘risk,’ getting it wrong. Again, one-one-one reading sessions could be an ideal way to address this problem. Graham and Kelly (1997) suggest that there should be a specific pattern to one-on-one reading sessions with young children, this pattern consists of five separate steps. ‘*Warming up the text,’* allows children to look at the book chosen with an adult, handling it and making links with their own experiences, making them feel more comfortable before they begin reading (Graham and Kelly 1997, 105). ‘*Reviewing the book,’* is also an important part of the confidence building process, and would allow Child A to give her opinion on the book without fear of failure, (Graham and Kelly 1997, 106). These strategies will hopefully help to \nbuild Child A’s self confidence and she should then eventually be able to give her opinions in shared and guided reading sessions.\n\nThe miscue analyses also indicated that the books from Child A’s ‘shelf,’ were perhaps too difficult for her, resulting in boredom and frustration, this could also have been the case during the guided reading sessions. Child A should be given books from a ‘lower shelf,’ to\n read in order to build up her self confidence. In addition to this, being placed with children of a similar, or slightly lower, ability for guided reading sessions could also have a positive impact.\n\n#### Speaking and Listening Analysis\n\nDuring whole-class, teacher-led activities Child A did not speak unless she was asked a direct question by the class teacher. On such occasions, Child A would sometimes respond accurately, at other times she would not respond at all. When the children were asked to respond to questions by raising their hands, Child A would not put up her hand. During such teaching sessions, Child A was often observed to be very restless, although she was keen to sit right at the front. The children were regularly asked to work with ‘talking partners,’ during the direct teaching, it was observed that Child A never responded to her partner in\n such situations, simply refusing to speak.\n\nDuring independent activities, Child A was observed to ignore other children on her table. Often her peers attempted to draw her into their activity or conversation, however, she did not respond to them in anyway, and indeed seemed to ignore them.\n\nChild A was also observed during ‘free-play,’ situations. Generally Child A would remain on her self-chosen task and did not initiate conversation with her peers. The exception to this being conflict situations, where Child A was extremely vocal in expressing her unhappiness to another child. When surrounded by other children, Child A still did not join in with their chatter. During free-play Child A would occasionally respond to a direct question from an adult observer, but at other times would attempt to ignore them. Occasionally Child A \nwould address a direct comment to an adult observer, in relation to her self-generated task, but did not then become engaged in conversation.\n\nPlay-times seemed to present a different view of Child A, in terms of her speaking and listening ability. She was observed on several occasions playing, with another girl from her class, a variety of different clapping and singing games. The two girls demonstrated \ndifferent games to each other, and were evidently listening and responding to each other.\n\n*‘Pupils talk about matters of immediate interest. They listen to others* *and usually respond appropriately. They convey simple meanings to* *a range of listeners, speaking audibly, and begin to extend their ideas* *or accounts by providing some detail.’*\n\n([www.nc.uk.net](http://www.nc.uk.net/))\n\nThis level descriptor indicates that, although Child A only meets part of the criteria for National Curriculum level 1, she is working at the lower end of this level. The observations made in the playground show that Child A is able, when the opportunity presents itself, to, *‘talk about matters of immediate interest,’* ([www.nc.uk.net](http://www.nc.uk.net/)).\n\n#### Implications for Teaching and Learning: Speaking and Listening\n\nThe evidence collected suggests that although Child A is confident when speaking to her peers at playtimes, she is not comfortable during class or group situations on and often prefers to remain silent. It is important to develop her ability to, ‘*listen to others,*’ and to, *‘respond appropriately,’* if Child A is to work towards National Curriculum level 2 for speaking and listening ([www.nc.uk.net](http://www.nc.uk.net/) ).\n\nOne of the key learning objectives for speaking and listening for children in Year One is, *‘to ask and answer questions, make relevant contributions, offer suggestions and take turns,’* (DFES 2003a, 24). The document Speaking, Listening, Learning: working with children in Key Stages 1 and 2 (DFES 2003a), offers some good suggestions for teaching towards this learning objective, and recommends a great deal of paired work, and teacher modelling of how to ask and answer questions. If Child A was able to observe adults modelling paired\n work, or some of her peers engaged in discussion work, she may start to feel sufficiently confident enough to join in herself. An additional strategy to help Child A during paired work, might be to try her with a variety of different partners to see if she responds better to a certain child.\n\n‘*All areas of the curriculum offer distinct opportunities for developing children’s speaking and listening,’* (DFES 2003b, 11) and consequently it may be possible to engage Child B more fully in speaking and listening activities when linked to a subject she enjoys. The use of paired discussion, could be better suited to a science lesson, for example, rather than confining such discussions to English lessons.\n\n#### Writing Analysis\n\nSeveral conversations with Child A led to the conclusion that she does perceive herself as a good writer. She enjoys writing for a purpose, she explained that she regularly writes lists and stories at home, giving them to her parents to read.\n\nIt is clear from examining the writing samples, that while Child A is confidently identifying the initial and final phonemes in words, and writing these down, she appears to be having more difficulty with medial phonemes, as many of these are missing from the words she has \nwritten down. For example in Appendix III, the writing clearly shows that Child A has attempted to write the word, ‘wonderful,’ however she has clearly identified the sounds at the beginning and ends of the word, but the middle sounds have not been clearly audible to her, resulting in the word, ‘wunful.’\n\nThe three samples of Child A’s writing which were examined (see Appendices I, II and III), indicate that she is making phonetically plausible attempts at words as the writing can be clearly read without the aid of the child in most places. Child A does show an awareness of \nhow to use full stops, although these are not consistently in the correct places. She does not yet seem aware that it is necessary to leave a clear space in between her words, and only does so in a couple of places. The evidence listed above, in conjunction with the writing samples contained within Appendices I, II, and III, indicate that Child A is working at National Curriculum level 1:\n\n*‘Pupils’ writing communicates meaning through simple words and* *phrases. In their* *reading or their writing, pupils begin to show* *awareness of how full stops are used. Letters are usually clearly* *shaped and correctly oriented.*\n\n([www.nc.uk.net](http://www.nc.uk.net/) )\n\nIt is clear from the above level descriptor, that although Child A is working at National Curriculum level 1, she does not meet all of the listed criteria and, therefore, should not be assessed for level 2.\n\n#### Implications for Teaching and Learning: Writing\n\nThe evidence given supports the suggestion that Child A is progressing through National Curriculum level 1 and into level 2. There are several things that could be done to support this transition. It could be said that her main development point is to improve her spelling\n and to start to recognise medial sounds in words. Child A also needs to start leaving finger spaces in between words and to start using full stops correctly.\n\nThe publication, Progression in Phonics: materials for whole class teaching, (DFES 1999) provides lots of suggestions for improving Child A’s ability to hear medial sounds. For example, the game, ‘Croaker,’ develops the children’s ability to hear and identify phonemes\n in a specified part of the word, using a puppet, (DFES 1999, 26). Such a game could improve Child A’s ability to hear and identify medial phonemes with the aim of improving her spelling.\n\nReid suggests that shared and modelled writing are effective ways of supporting young children’s writing development, (Reid in Bentley and Burman et al. 1999, 103-104). This could be a good way of improving Child A’s use of finger spaces and full stops. If the teacher models the correct use of full stops and finger spaces, and also makes lots of deliberate mistakes which the children can help to correct, Child A will begin to understand how to use full stops and finger spaces effectively in her own writing.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented above indicates that Child A is working at National Curriculum level 1 for her reading, writing and speaking and listening skills. It has already been suggested that effective teachers use what children already know as a basis for \ndeveloping their language skills and facilitating their progression. The evidence collected has been carefully analysed with this aim in mind, and areas for the development of Child A’s literacy skills have been identified. Adult modelling of the reading and writing process should play a key part in this development, if Child A is to make good progress towards National Curriculum level 2. Peer modelling could also play an important role, and could also help to foster Child A’s self confidence. It is important that all these suggestions are linked to other areas of the curriculum in order to engage and interest Child A, although this should also be of paramount importance when teaching all children. If all these suggestions are put into action, Child A should start to make sound progress and will, in addition, be playing an important part in this progression herself.\n","date":1614567000000,"_id":"z87pvIbOsjFnTmS7"}

There are several definitions of globalization however the k\nMerriam-Webster meaning is as follows. Globalization is the process by \nwhich businesses and other organizations develop international influence\n or start operating on an international scale. From shifting social \nnorms around the globe to changing how countries do business, \ntechnological advances, and intensifying competition in the workforce, \nas well as, the educational field; effects of globalization are \neverywhere and far reaching (Carnoy, 2002).\n\nGlobalization effects education all over the world. For example, due \nto intricate technological advances many jobs have been digitized. This \nmeans that the skill set that’s required for jobs have changed \ndramatically. Subsequently, jobs that could once be sustained by someone\n with a high school diploma or less have disappeared. These global and \neconomic changes cause shifts in the job market and are essentially \nchanging what is needed from the education system. We now need to \nprepare students for jobs that require different skill sets. Employees \nmust now be knowledgeable on foreign languages, cultures, and overall \nway of business to be successful in their career. For the most part the \nUnited States has been a leader in education compared to other \ncountries. Being the first country to achieve mass collegiate education,\n the United States of America always had the highest number of qualified\n people in its labor force. This is how the American economy was able to\n thrive and take advantage of the global market. But does this \nglobalization led to development or division in education? (Welch & \nMok, 2003) Well, in recent years countries around the world have \nrefocused on expanding education, many of the smaller, more impoverished\n countries actually working *together* to do so. Since graduating\n high school is now the standard in most countries, many are now setting\n goals to increase the number of college attendees even working with the\n United Nations to provide education for all countries! Although the \nUnited States has a greater number of older workers that are well \neducated, many other countries have a greater number of young workers \nwith college degrees. Nonetheless, with more high school graduates \nchasing college degrees and older people pursuing higher education after\n so many years of being out of school; this is changing too. People of \nall ages are pursuing higher education all over the world and with \neducation standards changing as well, we are truly living in an era like\n never before. We are all preparing for an interconnected world that \nglobalization has brought to us and education is just one small stepping\n stone for the high skill economy of the future (Young 1998, Brown et \nal. 2001).\n\nThe growing importance of education is more than wanting our \ncitizens to be smart. Countries are wanting their citizens to get \neducated in order to build for a future in which we are one global \ncitizen class that works together economically and otherwise to grow our\n countries. This can help with foreign policy and international business\n transactions and trades. To be knowledgeable of a certain country is to\n be more accepting and understanding of said countries culture and \nbeliefs. Appearing welcoming and friendly to different cultures will \nattract investments from foreign countries. This will boost the \ncountry’s economy (see OECD 1998, Campbell 2000). With a larger economy a\n countries revenue with increase and strengthen the country (ideally). \nThis is another reason why the quality of education is so important.\n\nWhile education systems all over the world are working on \nimproving and developing new ways to teach people; there is another way \npeople are gaining more and more knowledge in today society. The \ninternet. Not only is the use of computers and the internet now more \ncommon in the classroom it has also grown more common in everyday life \n(Martin Carnoy, 1999, pp.15-17). By using the internet society has \naccess to different kinds of information instantaneously. This makes \ngaining knowledge for students as well as non-students easier and faster\n than ever before. This is great when used as a means for students \nstruggling to comprehend course material or certain concepts, but with \nsuch a wide variety of information available, and it is important \nlearners are able to distinguish between dependable and untrustworthy \nresources. However for countries such as China or Iran who have limited \nto no access online; this can make a learning different concepts or \ngaining certain knowledge difficult because their governments often \nblock or edit information. Therefore citizens of those countries or \ncountries similar may actually have a skewed since of the truth because \nnot *all* information is given to them. In a way this widens the \ngap between the education progress of a developed country and an \nunderdeveloped country/country who may be banned from viewing certain \nmaterial. With technological advances making their way all around the \nglobe (globalization), eventually all countries will have access to any \ninformation they desire.\n\nGlobalization is a powerful and important process that influences\n economies, education systems, politics, and even social customs. With a\n growing sense of oneness; or “we are all global citizens in one world” \noutlooks, globalizations *positive* and increasing impact on education and societies growing desire to become more educated is obvious.","date":1618367880000,"_id":"UZALH5IXhhTImnEX"}
