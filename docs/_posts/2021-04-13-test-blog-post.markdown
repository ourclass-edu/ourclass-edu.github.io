A **blog** (a [truncation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(morphology) "Clipping (morphology)") of "**weblog**")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-1) is a discussion or informational [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website") published on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web") consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in [reverse chronological order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_chronology "Reverse chronology"), so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page "Web page"). Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*] occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or 
topic. In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the 
writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally [edited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing "Editing"). MABs from [newspapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper "Newspaper"), other [media outlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media "News media"), universities, [think tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank "Think tank"), [advocacy groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group "Advocacy group"), and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog [traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_traffic "Web traffic"). The rise of [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") and other "[microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging "Microblogging")" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. *Blog* can also be used as a verb, meaning *to maintain or add content to a blog*.

The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided 
with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of 
content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") or [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"). Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and [File Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol "File Transfer Protocol") had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker "Hacker") and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 "Web 2.0") websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this 
interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-2) In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of [social networking service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service "Social networking service").
 Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but 
also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-3) However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.

Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, 
ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics, and 
sports. Others function as more personal [online diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_diary "Online diary") or [online brand advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising "Online advertising") of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, [digital images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image "Digital image"), and [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Hyperlink") to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The 
ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact 
with other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of
 many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often [moderate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum#Moderators "Internet forum") and [filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordfilter "Wordfilter") online comments to remove [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech "Hate speech") or other offensive content. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (*[art blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_blog "Art blog")*), photographs (*[photoblogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoblog "Photoblog")*), videos (*[video blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_blog "Video blog")* or "*vlogs*"), music (*[MP3 blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3_blog "MP3 blog")*), and audio (*[podcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast "Podcast")*). In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as *[edublogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edublog "Edublog")*. [Microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging "Microblogging") is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.

'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media"),
 especially when the content is long-form and one creates and shares 
content on regular basis. So, one could be maintaining a blog on [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook "Facebook") or blogging on [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram "Instagram").

On February 16, 2011, there were over 156 million public blogs in existence.
On February 20, 2014, there were around 172 million [Tumblr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr "Tumblr")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-4) and 75.8 million [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress.com "WordPress.com")[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-5) blogs in existence worldwide. According to critics and other bloggers, [Blogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service) "Blogger (service)") is the most popular blogging service used today. However, Blogger does not offer public statistics.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-7) [Technorati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technorati "Technorati") lists 1.3 million blogs as of February 22, 2014.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-8)
