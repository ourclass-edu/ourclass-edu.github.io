The topic I am researching is ‘This is How Music is Taught’, where I 
examine the different pedagogical methods into teaching music within the
 classroom and how they are utilised most effectively to bring out the 
most of the student’s potential. The article ‘Pedagogical techniques and
 student outcomes in applied instrumental lessons taught by experienced 
and pre-service American music teachers’ by Henninger, Flowers and 
Councill highlights the importance of employing effective and versatile 
educational techniques, where they encourage further training into 
teachers to providing the best experience for music students. They 
compare teaching traits such as methods of explanation and teaching 
styles such as application and engagement. Junda’s article ‘Developing 
Readiness for Music Readiness’ builds on the notion of employing 
effective and purposeful teaching methods by emphasising the importance 
on student’s ability to utilise their voices. She explains the potential
 detrimental effects of achieving future musical pursuits without 
providing students with foundational skills in the classroom where she 
addresses some valuable and engaging musical activities that educators 
can implement within the classroom to combat this issue. Alongside 
providing students with knowledge of musical fundamentals, another 
aspect of effective classroom music teaching is educating the student’s 
social scope. McClung in his article ‘Extramusical Skills in the Music 
Classroom’ expresses the need of developing these aspects in young 
children into the musical classroom, rather than a concentration on only
 the music academia. As a possible future secondary teacher, this 
research on the different educational approaches has provided me with an
 insight with aspects I should take on board into my future classroom as
 well as methods in which I can approach learning throughout my studies 
and beyond.

The authors of this article base their research and findings on works 
including ‘Measure of instructional effectiveness in music research’ by 
R. A. Duke where learning outcomes can be better addressed through 
further improvement of educational methods. Also, Thomas W. Goolsby’s article ‘Time Use in Instrument Rehearsals: A
 Comparison of Experienced, Novice, and Student Teachers’ findings 
indicated that music educators with more experience tended to conduct 
their sessions more proficiently, using a range of techniques which 
allows a greater musical experience by student. Continued research and growth of effective teaching techniques for 
aspiring educators is beneficial to yield improvements in the quality 
and effectiveness in the music classroom. The writers of this article 
encourage further research into training and mentoring music educators 
to promote efficient skills to improve the learning experience of 
student musicians. They express concern regarding the teaching where a 
predominant focus of repetitive and somewhat monotonous learning was the
 methodology used by teachers of the less-experienced calibre. The student’s musical experience in the lesson seemed to be impacted by
 an overuse of criticism with a somewhat inappropriate proportioning of 
time between critiquing and student practical involvement, which affects
 the student being able to reach their potential. The amounts of 
negativity used by educators compared to words of praise and 
encouragement is unreasonably high. There are a range of strategies implied to address this matter, 
including the use of practical hands-on explanations where “modeling 
activities had a significance improved ear-to-hand coordination.” The rationale and reasoning should be included as part of teaching the material, alongside addressing the conceptual skill. A musical experiment of attempting to teach ‘Mary had a Little Lamb’ 
from both experienced and less-experienced educators indicated a more 
active verbal student participation, likely resulting from uses of 
effective remarks from them. The purpose of discussing this experiment is to highlight the benefits 
and outcomes to music students of utilising effective and purposeful 
pedagogical techniques which should be taught to music teachers. The 
exploration and experiment involved in the article suggests a need to 
implement good teaching habbits by teachers to raise the quality and 
confidence of the performance and learning experience by music students.
 Henninger’s later article ‘The Effects of Performance Quality Ratings 
on Perceptions of Instrumental Music Lessons’ investigated further into 
the types of scrutiny of teachers of the less-experience calibre

Rutkowsi’s article ‘The Measurement and Evaluation of Children’s Singing
 Voice Development’ expresses concern over the lack of success in 
learning and perplexing in music is caused by the inability to use the 
singing voice as a tool. If a larger emphasis is placed on educating and enhancing students 
understand of music fundamentals at an early age in the school 
classroom, the issue of unable to fully develop musically can be better 
addressed. Junda writes this article to address the necessity of 
fundamental music training in the school classroom in order for young 
students to engage musically in more difficult activities. The ability 
to recognise and interpret music notation and participate in more 
advanced musical tasks is hindered without successful mastery of a solid
 understanding of music basics. Although educators may be introducing 
musical material to students of a young age, their full potential may 
not be unlocked without implementing some changes to their teaching 
methodology. There are a range of teaching strategies and tools that 
educators can utilise within the music classroom to address this. 
Students can be introduced to basic and engaging activities using their 
singing voice to a range of activities. An engaging activity is for students to use their voices as 
onomatopoeia for real-life sounds. Educators should monitor their 
progression and provide constructive feedback to the students such as 
asking them to imitate a range notes and pitches to test their vocal 
ability. This coupled with peer reviewing is also encouraged. Furthermore, students can be trained to distinguish between different 
melodic patterns and note registers by practising with interpreting 
intervals.[[12]](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/teaching/pedagogical-methods-for-teaching-music.php#_ftn12) The concept of duration should also be introduced by activities such as “clap the rhythm”.
 The utilisation of these elementary activities means that students have
 a more sophisicated groundwork of the music fundamentals which they can
 use aboard in more difficult musical tasks. The ability to recognise 
notation can be more successful after grappling and achievement of these
 classroom tasks. The exploration of this article highlgihts the 
vitalness of training and mastery of the foundational skills within not 
only the music classroom, prior to the exposure of higher-order tasks. 
The article ‘Part Singing Revisited’ by Junda mentions students can have
 the ability to sing more advanced and demanding type singing 
activities, given they are equipped and trained with the foundational 
skills needed.

Writer McClung’s article refers to the works of William E. Fredrickson 
‘Social influence and Effects on Student Perception and Participation in
 Music’ where a valuable experience such as the exposure with music 
participation at a young age can unlock various positive and provocative
 memories.[[15]](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/teaching/pedagogical-methods-for-teaching-music.php#_ftn15) Daniel Goleman ‘Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ’
 article highlights the importance of the development of an emotional 
aspect in children referred to as “Emotional Quotient”. In order to train and learn these importance skills, a positive and 
encouraging environment is needed as such a musical space is used. 
McClung expresses concern over the lack of catering and development of 
various aspects of student’s cognitive and emotional attributes where 
this can be better addressed in the parameters of a music-orientated 
classroom. These emotional aspects cannot be fully dealt with and 
mentored with a mainly Intelligence-focused school curriculum, which may
 impact the students to maintain an appropriate level of mental 
healthiness and the ability to communicate their psychological and 
social needs.[[17]](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/teaching/pedagogical-methods-for-teaching-music.php#_ftn17) The arising issue cannot be overcome and dealt without a drastic change as “those who lack the skills necessary…is growing”.
 There are couple of strategies that are adopted by schools to combat 
this including the introducing and utilisation of “Extramusical Skills”.
 This could include the use of programs such as the school choir where 
student’s response to aspects such as “integrative associations, 
communicative emotions” had seen an improvement and these attributes were seen as of value. 
Also, a greater emphasis on integrating the Emotional Quotient component
 into the confines of the music classroom such as practising peer 
bonding and socialising should also be beneficial for children. The 
mastery of these types of behaviours can be effectively taught by 
incorporating each of these behavioural elements into certain learning 
outcomes of the music classroom and to create positive and motivating 
classroom activities for the students to put into practice alongside 
teaching the material. McClung suggests these changes to be put in place in schools as to 
address the previous concerns of the neglect of the Emotional Quotient 
training in students where these aspects can be trained in a 
music-orientated space where Fredrickson mentions memoriable expeirences
 can be experienced by a child. After implementing these adjustments to 
the delivery of syllabus material to the music classroom, these 
psychological factors in students can now be addressed in pupils which 
can ultimately leads to commendable results of a successful academic 
experience of both the Emotional and Intelligence Quotient. McClung’s exploration of this has allowed teachers to challenge and 
their methods of teaching and to ensure that the social aspect of 
students is better addressed in their classroom. His article ‘Using 
Video Self-Assessment to Enhance Nonverbal Conducting Gesture’ 
highlights the importance of effective conducting techniques, a 
communicative behaviour which can be used effectively in a musical 
setting, likewise with the training of social skills.

The research that I have gathered and learnt throughout has provided me 
with innovative approaches to learning and attributes which I can 
utilise in not only my future studies at the university, but in 
addition, as an aspiring high school teacher. As a contemporary music 
student, one of the skills involved in music production is the ability 
to be proficient at utilising a DAW such as Logic Pro X. The mastery of 
this software may take some time and practise. As the second articles 
highlights the need for a well-developed foundational base, one of the 
units of study which I will undertake in Semester 2 is called ‘Creative 
Music Technology’, where I hope to continue to develop and hone in my 
basic DAW skills, prior to pursing more advanced and higher-level 
musical projects in the future. In addition with one of the music skills
 units ‘Fundamentals of Music 3’, it will be beneficial for my learning 
if I revise needed material from ‘Fundamentals of Music 2’ as some of 
the new content learnt may be expanded on from the latter course which I
 completed this semester. Furthermore, as an aspiring secondary music or
 mathematics teacher, I value the importance of equipping students with 
rudimentary skills prior to introducing harder concepts. For example, 
the concept of duration can be introduced by asking students to clap 
along to nursery rhymes such as ‘Humpty Dumpty’ and ‘The Grand Old Duke 
of York’ as I play it on the piano to identify the rhythm, prior to 
writing the meter. In relation to the first article, employing 
purposeful teaching methodology and to focus on the rationale rather 
than a somewhat ineffective memorising exercise, I hope to provide a 
purposeful and hands-on learning experience for my future students, 
including the ‘why?’ in my explanations to hopefully engage my students 
in the classroom. For example, when introducing a formula, I try to 
provide students with a derivation of the formula, rather than just 
completing questions. Monitoring and recording my student’s progress is 
essential in their academic development. Finally, in terms of the third 
article, addressing the social and behavioural aspects of students in 
the classroom is necessary to promote aspects such as communication and 
interaction between my students.
