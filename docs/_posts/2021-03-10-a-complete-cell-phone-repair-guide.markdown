Imagine yourself scrolling through your social media feed and before 
you know the gravity is pulling your phone towards the ground it hits 
the ground with a loud thud.

Feels like a heartbreak, doesn’t it?

- Are you wondering what to do next?

Your phone needs repair, but what should your very first move be. You
 are probably wondering where and how to get the services from. Read on 
to this guide, for we will explain step by step everything you need to 
know to fix your phone.

- Google it!

First and foremost, you need a reputable company that could fix your 
phone. So open the web browser and in the google search engine type, ‘Cell Phone Repair near me',
 and it will give you a list of places you get your phone fixed from. 
Always remember, not every company lives by its claim, so do a little 
investigation before choosing to opt for one repairing company.

- Check the cost

The repairing cost, although varies on a lot of factors, you should 
only pay for the services that you think are worthwhile. However, keep 
in mind the following factors.

- The phone kind 

Some phones are more complicated than others, therefore do not get 
offended if you are getting charged more for your screen damage than 
someone you know. Usually, older models are cheaper to repair than the 
more advanced or newer models. Similarly, you will notice a repair price
 difference in Apple, Windows, and Android phones.

- The fixture type

What you are having fixed influences the cost like nothing else. So 
you can not expect to pay the same price for getting your phone and 
battery fixed. 

- Check the screen repair

 If you have gotten the spiderweb-like patterns on your phone screen, then you need to get your screen fixed immediately.

- Where to go?

You can either check the warranty and send it to the manufacturers. 
Doing so will save you from spending a big chunk of your money, but this
 might also take longer.

- The water damage

Like every other damage, the cost of water damage in your phone 
varies. The greater the extent of damage the more you would be charged.

1. First, get your phone examined. There are some generous repair shops
  like Regina Mobile Q that will give a free diagnostic check. After a 
  thorough examination, the repairers will let you know what you can 
  expect to pay.
  
2. Unfortunately not every water damage can be examined right away. 
  Sometimes, even after getting your phone repaired, you come home to 
  realize that you have not completely got the problem solved. The bottom 
  line is, you should always be prepared to pay for your phone repair 
  unless it is totally out of your budget.
  

- Does Phone repairs affect the warranty?

It is a commonly held misconception that getting your phone repaired 
will affect its warranty. So the good news is, you can get your phone 
fixed all the while retaining its warranty. Nevertheless, before buying 
an expensive phone or any expensive electronic device, you should make 
sure you are aware of the policies and protection plan.

Today, cell phones have a computing power greater than the computers 
of a decade ago. The modern features in your phone allow you to not just
 communicate, but also learn and entertain yourself. Therefore, a phone 
not working right can affect your life more than you can anticipate. 
Many different phone companies make different products and that is why 
detecting the issue in your phone is sometimes a task per se. Therefore,
 it is always best to leave the complicated work in the hand of experts.
