You probably have heard of AR/VR/MR technologies in the past. They 
are collectively known as XR (extended reality). For most people, these 
terms are quite abstract and often perceived as the science-fiction in 
Hollywood movies. But the infiltration of computer-generated objects 
already exists in our lives, we just don’t realise as a user.

You might have tried to catch Pokemon in recent times or using 
bitmoji with the Snapchat camera. That is actually AR (Augmented 
Reality). There are various other groundbreaking use cases of AR in 
several industries. Many tech companies and engineers around the globe 
are working to implement these technologies into business operations to 
bring efficiency.

#### What is the Extended Reality (XR)?

Extended Reality (XR) is an umbrella term for all the immersive 
technologies including Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and
 Mixed Reality (MR). All the technologies that extend reality by 
blending virtual worlds with the real or creating only virtual worlds 
are included in XR, including those technologies that are still to be 
developed. [A recent survey](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/extended-reality-xr/) revealed
 that more than 60% of respondents voted for XR being the mainstream in 
the upcoming five years. Following are the technologies included 
currently in the XR technologies:

#### AR – What is Augmented Reality?

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that provides a view of the 
real-world environment with superimposed computer-generated elements 
(graphics), which ultimately changes real-world perception. In other 
words, it is the technology that adds layers of digital information to 
the real environment.

Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t create a whole artificial 
surroundings that replace the real world. AR modifies the existing 
real-world environment with elements like sounds, motions, and graphics.

The term Augmented Reality (AR) was coined back in 1990. The initial 
commercialisations of AR were in the television and military sector and 
the rise of smartphones and internet connectivity has introduced a 
second wave, introducing AR into the common man’s life.

The technology is massively improving the manufacturing sector where 
products are directly projected via 3D models and fused together in 
real-time. Also, there are many augmented reality apps that are helping 
individuals with their health and entertainment.

#### VR – What is Virtual Reality?

In almost opposition to AR, the virtual reality experience is a fully
 immersive simulated digital environment, which is experienced by the 
users through wearable gadgets i.e. VR headsets or head-mounted 
displays. These VR gadgets provide users with a 360-degree view into the
 completely artificial world that literally fools the brain into 
believing that it is the reality.

Many [tech companies and VR developers](https://www.nimbleappgenie.com/) have
 created artificial environments using VR technology, i.e. swimming 
underwater, walking on mars, battlefield, and many more. The gaming and 
entertainment industry are the early adopters of VR technology and many 
other industries including healthcare, military, education, engineering 
are pilot testing VR for several use cases.

#### MR – What is Mixed Reality?

Though this technology is still in its initial stage, Microsoft has 
tested it with their product HoloLens. It allows users to place a 
virtual digital object into the real environment (your room) and gives 
the users an ability to move, spin or interact with that digital object.

Also known as hybrid reality, the mixed reality is where the real and
 digital world objects co-exist and can interact with each other in 
real-time. MR technology requires very high processing power as compared
 to AR and VR. There are many tech companies that are exploring the 
possibilities where they can put MR to work.

#### Top 5 AR and VR trends in 2021

The year 2019 was a golden year for technological advancements, where we saw disrupting technologies such as [AI & ML](https://www.nimbleappgenie.com/blogs/the-types-of-ai-and-the-ways-it-is-reshaping-it/),
 AR & VR, and IoT flourishing. The XR (AR & VR) technologies 
have specifically shown their potential in the fields of gaming and 
entertainment. 

[IDC forecasted](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45679219) that
 the worldwide spending on XR is expected to grow with 78.5% from 2019 
to reach $18.8 billion by the end of this year. The industry experts 
believe that we’ll witness a whole new load of next-gen XR powered 
gadgets that will provide users with immersion and realism of a greater 
extent. However, the industrial usage of XR has outpaced gaming and 
entertainment.

#### Industrial Use of AR & VR technologies is outpacing the consumer-oriented implementations

The first interaction most people have with XR technologies is in 
gaming and entertainment. This may be the reality till now, but it won’t
 be in future as some research shows that the industry’s focus is 
shifting towards enterprise XR solution development.

The report by VR Intelligence states that 65% of AR development 
companies are working on building AR-powered industrial applications 
whereas only 37% are working on consumer applications and gadgets.

Although the recent popular implementation of XR in consumer 
applications such as Facebook’s Oculus Rift and Pokemon Go has made the 
headlines,
 this industrial trend of XR isn’t surprising as it’s potential to boost
 productivity and ensure safety was a lucrative proposition for the 
enterprises.
