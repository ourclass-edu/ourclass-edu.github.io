The Pacific Northwest tree octopus (*Octopus paxarbolis*) can be found in the [temperate rainforests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_rainforest) of the Olympic Peninsula on the west coast of North America. Their 
habitat lies on the Eastern side of the Olympic mountain range, adjacent
 to Hood Canal. These solitary cephalopods reach an average size 
(measured from arm-tip to mantle-tip,) of 30-33 cm. Unlike most other 
cephalopods, tree octopuses are amphibious, spending only their early 
life and the period of their mating season in their ancestral aquatic 
environment. Because of the moistness of the rainforests and specialized
 skin adaptations, they are able to keep from becoming desiccated for 
prolonged periods of time, but given the chance they would prefer 
resting in pooled water.

An intelligent and inquisitive being (it has the largest 
brain-to-body ratio for any mollusk), the tree octopus explores its 
arboreal world by both touch and sight. Adaptations its ancestors 
originally evolved in the three dimensional environment of the sea have 
been put to good use in the spatially complex maze of the [coniferous Olympic rainforests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_National_Park).
 The challenges and richness of this environment (and the intimate way 
in which it interacts with it,) may account for the tree octopus's 
advanced behavioral development. (Some evolutionary theorists suppose 
that "arboreal adaptation" is what laid the groundwork in primates for 
the evolution of the human mind.)

Reaching out with one of her eight arms, each covered in sensitive 
suckers, a tree octopus might grab a branch to pull herself along in a 
form of locomotion called tentaculation; or she might be preparing to 
strike at an insect or small vertebrate, such as a frog or rodent, or 
steal an egg from a bird's nest; or she might even be examining some 
object that caught her fancy, instinctively desiring to manipulate it 
with her dexterous limbs (really deserving the title "sensory organs" 
more than mere "limbs",) in order to better know it.

Tree octopuses have eyesight comparable to humans. Besides allowing 
them to see their prey and environment, it helps them in inter-octopus 
relations. Although they are not social animals like us, they display to
 one-another their emotions through their ability to change the color of
 their skin: red indicates anger, white fear, while they normally 
maintain a mottled brown tone to blend in with the background.

The reproductive cycle of the tree octopus is still linked to its 
roots in the waters of the Puget Sound from where it is thought to have 
originated. Every year, in Spring, tree octopuses leave their homes in 
the [Olympic National Forest](http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/) and migrate towards the shore and, eventually, their spawning grounds 
in Hood Canal. There, they congregate (the only real social time in 
their lives,) and find mates. After the male has deposited his sperm, he
 returns to the forests, leaving the female to find an aquatic lair in 
which to attach her strands of egg-clusters. The female will guard and 
care for her eggs until they hatch, refusing even to eat, and usually 
dying from her selflessness. The young will spend the first month or so 
floating through Hood Canal, Admiralty Inlet, and as far as North Puget 
Sound before eventually moving out of the water and beginning their 
adult lives.

### Why It's Endangered

Although the tree octopus is not officially listed on the Endangered
Species List, we feel that it should be added since its numbers are at a
 critically low level for its breeding needs. The reasons for this dire 
situation include: decimation of habitat by logging and suburban 
encroachment; building of roads that cut off access to the water which 
it needs for spawning; predation by foreign species such as house cats; 
and booming populations of its natural predators, including the bald 
eagle and [sasquatch](https://zapatopi.net/bsa/octopus.html).
 What few that make it to the Canal are further hampered in their 
reproduction by the growing problem of pollution from farming and 
residential run-off. Unless immediate action is taken to protect this 
species and its habitat, the Pacific Northwest tree octopus will be but a
 memory.

The possibility of Pacific Northwest tree octopus extinction is not 
an unwarranted fear. Other tree octopus species—including the Douglas 
octopus and the red-ringed madrona sucker—were once abundant throughout 
the Cascadia region, but have since gone extinct because of threats 
similar to those faced by *paxarbolis*, as well as overharvesting by the now-illegal tree octopus trade.

The history of the tree octopus trade is a sad one. Their voracious 
appetite for bird plumes having exhausted all the worthy species of that
 family, the fashionistas moved on to cephalopodic accoutrements during 
the early 20th Century. Tree octopuses became prized by the fashion 
industry as ornamental decorations for hats, leading greedy trappers to 
wipe out whole populations to feed the vanity of the fashionable rich. 
While fortunately this practice has been outlawed, its effects still 
reverberate today as these millinery deprivations brought tree octopus 
numbers below the critical point where even minor environmental change 
could cause disaster.

While efforts were made in the past to preserve remaining tree 
octopus habitat, these were met with resistance by the timber industry, 
which has traditionally viewed the tree octopus [as a nuisance](https://zapatopi.net/blog/?post=200812287770.an_octopus_in_a_saw-mill),
 both because the octopuses favor the valuable, moss-shrouded trees of 
old growth forests—pitting conservation needs against lucrative sources 
of lumber—and because octopuses hiding among felled trees often gummed 
up sawmills and stained pulp vats with their ink.

![](https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/bones_hartzell-tree_octopus_exhibit.jpg)*Traveling sideshow exhibits, such as this one by Glen "Bones" Hartzell from 1942, demonized tree octopuses to the ignorant masses.*

These nuisances led many loggers to regard tree octopuses as bad 
luck, resulting in the pointless killing of octopuses on sight at 
logging camps in a misguided attempt at eradicating the troublesome 
species. Anti-octopus sentiment was so strong among loggers that some 
even began to fear that the octopuses were prone to attacking humans.

These fears were fueled in no small part by gratuitous stories 
involving tree octopuses harassing lumberjacks and distressing damsels 
in Northwestern-themed pulp magazines of the 1930-40s and variously 
"nipping", "entangling", or "suckering the flesh" of the heroes of men's
 action magazines of the 1950-60s. (The magazine publishers depended on 
cheap paper made from wood pulp and were glad to contribute to the 
anti-octopus propaganda campaign of the timber industry.)

To this day, misunderstanding and fear of these gentle creatures can 
still be found among many old timers, although education campaigns—and 
special octopus-separators installed at sawmills—have largely halted the
 practice of tree octopus eradication.
