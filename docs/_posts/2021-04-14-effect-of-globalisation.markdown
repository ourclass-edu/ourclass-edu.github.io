Globalization brings many changes to people’s lives all over the 
world. There are several definitions of globalization however the 
Merriam-Webster meaning is as follows. Globalization is the process by 
which businesses and other organizations develop international influence
 or start operating on an international scale. From shifting social 
norms around the globe to changing how countries do business, 
technological advances, and intensifying competition in the workforce, 
as well as, the educational field; effects of globalization are 
everywhere and far reaching (Carnoy, 2002).

Globalization effects education all over the world. For example, due 
to intricate technological advances many jobs have been digitized. This 
means that the skill set that’s required for jobs have changed 
dramatically. Subsequently, jobs that could once be sustained by someone
 with a high school diploma or less have disappeared. These global and 
economic changes cause shifts in the job market and are essentially 
changing what is needed from the education system. We now need to 
prepare students for jobs that require different skill sets. Employees 
must now be knowledgeable on foreign languages, cultures, and overall 
way of business to be successful in their career. For the most part the 
United States has been a leader in education compared to other 
countries. Being the first country to achieve mass collegiate education,
 the United States of America always had the highest number of qualified
 people in its labor force. This is how the American economy was able to
 thrive and take advantage of the global market. But does this 
globalization led to development or division in education? (Welch & 
Mok, 2003) Well, in recent years countries around the world have 
refocused on expanding education, many of the smaller, more impoverished
 countries actually working *together* to do so. Since graduating
 high school is now the standard in most countries, many are now setting
 goals to increase the number of college attendees even working with the
 United Nations to provide education for all countries! Although the 
United States has a greater number of older workers that are well 
educated, many other countries have a greater number of young workers 
with college degrees. Nonetheless, with more high school graduates 
chasing college degrees and older people pursuing higher education after
 so many years of being out of school; this is changing too. People of 
all ages are pursuing higher education all over the world and with 
education standards changing as well, we are truly living in an era like
 never before. We are all preparing for an interconnected world that 
globalization has brought to us and education is just one small stepping
 stone for the high skill economy of the future (Young 1998, Brown et 
al. 2001).

The growing importance of education is more than wanting our 
citizens to be smart. Countries are wanting their citizens to get 
educated in order to build for a future in which we are one global 
citizen class that works together economically and otherwise to grow our
 countries. This can help with foreign policy and international business
 transactions and trades. To be knowledgeable of a certain country is to
 be more accepting and understanding of said countries culture and 
beliefs. Appearing welcoming and friendly to different cultures will 
attract investments from foreign countries. This will boost the 
country’s economy (see OECD 1998, Campbell 2000). With a larger economy a
 countries revenue with increase and strengthen the country (ideally). 
This is another reason why the quality of education is so important.

While education systems all over the world are working on 
improving and developing new ways to teach people; there is another way 
people are gaining more and more knowledge in today society. The 
internet. Not only is the use of computers and the internet now more 
common in the classroom it has also grown more common in everyday life 
(Martin Carnoy, 1999, pp.15-17). By using the internet society has 
access to different kinds of information instantaneously. This makes 
gaining knowledge for students as well as non-students easier and faster
 than ever before. This is great when used as a means for students 
struggling to comprehend course material or certain concepts, but with 
such a wide variety of information available, and it is important 
learners are able to distinguish between dependable and untrustworthy 
resources. However for countries such as China or Iran who have limited 
to no access online; this can make a learning different concepts or 
gaining certain knowledge difficult because their governments often 
block or edit information. Therefore citizens of those countries or 
countries similar may actually have a skewed since of the truth because 
not *all* information is given to them. In a way this widens the 
gap between the education progress of a developed country and an 
underdeveloped country/country who may be banned from viewing certain 
material. With technological advances making their way all around the 
globe (globalization), eventually all countries will have access to any 
information they desire.

Globalization is a powerful and important process that influences
 economies, education systems, politics, and even social customs. With a
 growing sense of oneness; or “we are all global citizens in one world” 
outlooks, globalizations *positive* and increasing impact on education and societies growing desire to become more educated is obvious.
