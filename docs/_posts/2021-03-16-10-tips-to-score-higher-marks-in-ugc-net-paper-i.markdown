Hello future professors,

Greetings from Ourclass !

In this blog, we will share with you 10 tips to score higher marks in UGC NET Paper I.

#### Introduction
Clearing the UGC NET exam is a tough task for many aspirants. Most people fail in the exam because of lack of proper guidance and orientation. Being an objective test, it is very easy to score higher marks in UGC NET if the aspirant follows a proper strategy. 

It is not an issue for most of the aspirants to score decent marks in Paper II as they have studied it or have been studying it in their post-graduation. But, Paper I gives tough luck to many. A lot of aspirants could only score less than 50 percent for Paper I, and most of the other aspirants score lesser marks for Paper I when compared with Paper II. Even some of the NET qualified candidates fail to reach the JRF benchmark score due to low marks in Paper I

It is a popular disbelief that Paper I is tough as it contains those topics which a typical aspirant doesn’t pay much attention to. Most aspirants  from the Arts and Humanities stream have that inherent dislike towards General Knowledge, Quantitative Aptitude and Reasoning. 

They believe scoring good marks in these subjects is a Herculean task and give up Paper I preparations fully thinking it is not their cup of tea. But, the fact is that Paper I, if you score better in it, can be the gamechanger of your career. Since everyone prepares for Paper II, there won’t be much difference in it’s marks between different aspirants. But, if you are able to get a few more questions in Paper I right, it will bring a huge change in your total marks, ultimately hitting the NET or JRF benchmark. 

In this blog, we will give you 10 tips to score higher marks in Paper I so that clearing NET or JRF will be a lot easier for you. 

#### Tip 1 - Understand the Syllabus:
Paper I syllabus contains 10 Units and UGC has clearly given the different subtopics under each one of them in their website. UGC won’t deviate from what is given in the syllabus and there will be five questions each from these 10 Units, with 2 marks for each question, that is, a total of 50 questions worth 100 marks. 

For easier comparison, we have divided the syllabus into 3 broad areas - General Awareness, Quantitative Aptitude and Reasoning, and Teaching and Research Orientation. General Awareness comprises ICT, Environment and Higher Education. Quantitative Aptitude and Reasoning include those subjects that involve numbers, problem solving and critical thinking such as Mathematical Reasoning and Aptitude, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation. Teaching and Research Orientation include Teaching Aptitude, Research Aptitude and Communication. We did not include Comprehension under any of them as it is an easy bite for all the aspirants to get 5 out of 5.

#### Tip 2 - Solving Previous Year Question Papers:
This is an important task every aspirant should follow. But, aspirants rarely go through Previous Year Questions or other Practice Questions such as Mock Tests from coaching institutes. Solving Previous Questions has two fold benefits. Firstly, it would help you in understanding where you stand now in terms of marks and in which all subjects you have scored better. Apart from that this would also help you in understanding those specific areas or sub-topics which are UGC’s hot favorites from which they ask a lot of questions. 

We will insist you to practice more of UGC’s Previous Year Questions when compared with Practice Questions from Coaching Institutes as the people who are putting questions for UGC have a similar mentality and similar interests, and there are chances that these questions may repeat exactly as they are or in a different form.

#### Tip 3 - Understand Your Past Mistakes:
If you are not a newbie to UGC NET, it is important that you must critically evaluate your mistakes in the previous attempts. These might include not giving enough importance to Paper I preparations, reaching the examination hall late, spending too much time on any topic, not attempting all the questions etc. If you get an idea about what all things have gone wrong in the past attempts, it helps in you creating a new strategy which is free of mistakes. 

If you are a newbie on the other hand, don’t make the mistakes your seniors or friends have made. Get advice from those around you regarding where you can make mistakes, so that you yourself won’t make one.

#### Tip 4 - Know Your Interests:
Every aspirant should be able to know their areas of interests from the topics covered in the syllabus. You might have got a brief idea about your areas of interest from solving previous questions. You also have to self introspect, i.e. understand what are your strengths and your weaknesses in attempting the Paper. 

For example, some people may spend more time on Paper I in general which kills their time to perform well in Paper II, whereas some others are quick with Paper I. Some people may spend more time on math related questions and perform very badly in that, while some others may be good with numbers. Tension and stress during the exam is the biggest hurdle for some aspirants, which may not be the case with a few others.

As strengths and weaknesses are different for different people, aspirants themselves have to understand them, take note of them, remember them while preparing and attempting the exam.

#### Tip 5- Learn, Learn and Learn:
There is no alternative to learning, and no candidate who cracked the exam would say they cleared it without learning. Learning is an ongoing process. Some people have been learning from their childhood and therefore they may not need to prepare exclusively for the exam. Others need to put extra efforts on preparing for Paper I. 

Getting more than 35 questions right, i.e. scoring more than 70 percent in Paper I is a deciding factor in winning JRF, and for that your knowledge base is a prerequisite. Continuous learning improves this knowledge base and learning like this would be more helpful when compared with learning for the sake of passing the exam. So, find all possible resources that would help you learn - newspapers, study materials, videos, coaching classes etc. and get started.

#### Tip 6 - Revise and Remember:
Learning does not end with reading and mugging up facts; it also includes revisiting the topics that you have covered so that you can know whether you remember them. Revision is a key component of clearing the NTA NET.

You should revise all the portions you studied till you can answer them even in your sleep. As the syllabus for the exam is not that vast like other exams and the questions are pretty predictable, you don’t need vast reading for the exam. Instead, more focussed reading and revising them will suffice for NET aspirants. 

#### Tip 7 - Practice More Questions:
Doing more and more practice questions not only helps you in understanding where you stand now, but also it helps in gaining knowledge in areas which you left out while preparing. Above all, practicing questions helps the aspirant in understanding the logic and pattern of the examination. 

This is an important step that should not be forgotten as every examination has its own specific pattern of asking questions and when you crack the logic of it, it becomes easier for you to score better in it. We can’t clear the UPSC Civil Services Examination with the same logic of clearing the NET examination. We will detail the steps to crack the logic of attempting UGC NET questions in a separate blog.

Tip 8 - Prepare a Clear Cut Strategy Before the Exam: 
Strategies win every battle, so is in the case of NET. A well drawn out strategy is as important as your preparation. You can start making your strategy from the beginning of your preparation, by culminating all the steps mentioned above - understanding the syllabus, knowing your areas of interest and past mistakes etc.

A few days before the exam, you must come with a clear strategy as to how you are going to attempt the test. It can range from how much time you will spend for each paper, how you will attempt questions you have not heard of, how you will deduce the correct answer from different similar options etc.

#### Tip 9 - Be Optimistic and Tension Free: 
Even if you have covered every nook and corner of the syllabus, it doesn’t guarantee you success unless you are optimistic and free of tension. Tension kills more NET dreams than lack of preparation does. 

As traits related to optimism are psychological, it demands repeated efforts to make yourself optimistic and tension free. You have to make yourself believe that you will clear the exam, no matter what. You can increase your self confidence through practicing meditation, cementing the thought of clearing the test in your mind through any methods you find suitable. You can kill your stress and tension through attempting more mock tests in an environment similar to the NET examination, listening to music or watching motivational videos on Youtube etc.

#### Tip 10 - Leverage and Transform: 
Now that you have understood from the above steps about your strengths, weaknesses and interests, and attained sufficient knowledge from learning, revising and solving questions, it is important that the aspirants should leverage on their knowledge and strengths, and minimise the impact of their weaknesses in the examination. For example, if you are inherently good at certain types of questions then you don’t need to spend much time on preparing that. Whereas, you can practice more questions from those units which are tougher for you. 

If you find certain portions, for example math related questions, tough and you have been constantly scoring poor marks in such questions, it is better that you don’t spend much time on such questions in the examination hall. You can also otherwise select 5 or 6 areas in which you are good at, learn everything from it and attempt the test. 

#### Conclusion
As every individual is different in tastes, interests, strengths and weaknesses, it is upto the aspirant to  finally decide what they have to follow. We can and we have only given general tips for those NET aspirants who have no idea about how to score better in Paper I. It is upto you to take these tips and use them on your respective personal situations and prepare.
