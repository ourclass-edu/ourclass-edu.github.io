#### When does discovery happen in a lawsuit

In a civil suit the parties must gather their own evidence through the 
structured process of discovery.  Those involved in a civil suit are 
called a party because they can be individuals or business entities. 
Because most parties store data electronically the process of discovery 
relating to that data is not surprisingly called eDiscovery.

In a criminal case the authorities often investigate and secure evidence 
before charging someone with a crime. In contrast a party might file its
 civil lawsuit based only on a good faith belief of the actions of the 
other side. They then have to use discovery to gather the evidence to 
prove their case. The rules of civil procedure give structure to the 
discovery process. The rules of evidence and lend guidance and help 
limit discovery. This is, of course an oversimplification of the process but you get the idea.

#### What can I ask for in discovery and how

In a civil suit each party can ask the other side for documents and 
information.  Documents are obtained through Requests to Produce. These 
requests also reach electronically stored information or ESI. Other 
information can be obtained through written questions called 
Interrogatories or orally through a deposition or both. Parties can also
 verify certain facts by asking the other side to admit them in Requests
 for Admissions.

#### Can I ask someone outside the lawsuit for documents

In some cases the party holding key information may not be part of the 
lawsuit.  Discovery can be obtained from these non-parties or third 
parties through a deposition or document request without a deposition. 
But Interrogatories and Requests for Admissions cannot be used with a 
third party. Those may only be directed to another party in a lawsuit. 

#### How does discovery actually work

Discovery takes time to complete. Large blocks of time are purposely 
built into our discovery rules. This is Sometimes why lawsuits take so 
long. But I believe the time intentionally injected into discovery 
allows the parties to gain perspective over the dispute. That time also 
allows cooler heads to prevail as the saying goes.  
After sending a discovery request to another party you normally have to wait at least
 30 days for a response. This can even be longer depending on the 
circumstances. Discovery requests may also require the intervention of 
the judge. That can delay the process as you wait for a hearing date. It
 can also increase the expenses of the lawsuit.
