#### Initial Thoughts

1. Is it the responsibility of teachers to teach study skills strategies? Explain your response.
  

- I believe that it is the teacher’s responsibility to teach study skills 
  strategies. First and foremost, when students harbor study skills, 
  teachers would spend less time re-teaching certain content because 
  students did not grasp the content in the beginning.  Study skills 
  strategies refer to things individuals have to do when they need to 
  locate and remember information. For example, being organized is a study
   skill that should be taught. It is pertinent for teachers to understand
   that the majority of organization methods do not work for all students,
   therefore, teachers’ must teach different organizational strategies. 
  When students are organized, they will allocate information quicker, 
  coupled with, teachers teaching memorization strategies. Memorization 
  skills consist of forms of repeating or re-writing the information or 
  using flashcards. Looking at long pages of information or notes will not
   help students retain any information. Finally, every student needs to 
  be taught note-taking strategies. Not only should teachers teach the 
  importance of note-taking, but they should teach various strategies. For
   example, if a student is taught to review notes periodically, they 
  would be able to reiterate what they’ve learned, plus, it will give them
   the opportunity to retain any information they’ve missed the first 
  time. If students are taught study skills strategies, they will be able 
  to use the information effectively. In addition, students with executive
   functions deficits would succeed academically if they are explicitly 
  taught how to approach academic tasks. That being said, every teacher 
  should devote their time to help students learn *how* to study.
  

2. Which study skills strategies can improve students’ academic performance?
  

- There are several study skills strategies that can improve a student’s 
  academic performance. Some study skills strategies consist of *graphic organizers,* *comprehension
   strategies, mnemonic strategies, note-taking strategies, organization 
  strategies, time management, and self-regulation.* First and 
  foremost, graphic organizers help students organize information, compare
   the relationship between ideas, and apply information. In addition, 
  graphic organizers help students make connections to what they already 
  know. Comprehension strategies help students identify relevant 
  information within a text and make connections to prior knowledge. This 
  is important because students who have learning difficulties often 
  experience challenges in processing information, as a result, it will 
  affect their ability to understand the text. Mnemonic strategies are 
  known as memory strategies. Mnemonic strategies utilize visual or 
  auditory clues to help students make connections to what they know and 
  new information. Note-taking strategies help students understand 
  information that is presented in books and lectures, it helps students 
  process important information, and keep them engaged with the material. 
  Organization strategies can improve student’s academic performance by 
  helping them stay on-task, prepared, and efficient, whereas, students 
  who are not organized will most likely face academic challenges. For 
  example, if a student records their next assignment on a piece of paper 
  and accidentally throw it away, the student will be at risk of failing 
  that assignment due to unpreparedness. Time management strategies help 
  students gain a sense of how long an assignment might take. Without it, 
  students will overestimate or underestimate the time needed to complete a
   task. Last but not least, self-regulation strategies help students use 
  learning strategies. For instance, students will be able to grasp the 
  idea of knowing when to use a certain strategy. The four self-regulation
   strategies are self-monitoring, keeping track of progress; 
  self-instruction, students create encouraging statements through a task 
  or activity; goal setting establishes achievable objectives for 
  learning; and self-reinforcement, students uses intrinsic rewards when 
  something has been completed. 

#### Assessment

1. Because students with learning difficulties often have deficits in executive functions, they are at risk of academic failure.
  
  1. List four critical activities related to learning that might be affected by these deficits.

- In this day and age, students are expected to read independently and 
  extract information from textbooks, complete assignments with 
  multi-steps, and use appropriate study strategies. This is due to 
  increasing expectations and difficult content, however, students with 
  learning difficulties and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are 
  at risk of failing than are their peers without disabilities. One major 
  reason why students struggle is because they have deficits in executive 
  functions. Executive functions are the mental processes that regulate 
  and coordinate activities related to learning, including processing 
  information, retaining and recalling information, organizing materials 
  and time, and using effective learning and study strategies. If students
   learn how to gain and use information effectively, then students who 
  have executive function deficits need to be explicitly taught how to 
  approach academic tasks strategically. Therefore, they need to be taught
   effective study skills. Individual strategies can be implemented to 
  address problems students might have with four critical activities 
  associated with learning. The four processes include *processing 
  information, retaining and recalling information, organizing materials 
  and managing time, and selecting, monitoring and using strategies.*
  
  2. For each of these activities, identify at least one study skills 
    strategy that might help these students to improve their academic 
    performance.
- If students learn how to gain and use information effectively, then 
  students who have executive function deficits need to be explicitly 
  taught how to approach academic tasks strategically. Therefore, they 
  need to be taught effective study skills. Individual strategies can be 
  implemented to address problems students might have with four critical 
  activities associated with learning. Activities related to learning 
  consist of *processing information, retaining and recalling 
  information, organizing materials and managing time, and selecting, 
  monitoring and using strategies.*
  
  First, *processing information* study skills 
  strategy requires the use of graphic organizers. There are several 
  graphic organizers that serve different purposes. For example, to 
  address the cause and effect, the fishbone diagram and problem and 
  solution map are the perfect organizer. In addition, the web graphic 
  organizer helps students with classifying; the Venn diagram helps 
  students compare and contrast; the word web is used for describing, and 
  the flowchart cycle is used for sequencing. Second, *retaining and recalling information* requires note-taking strategies. There are several note-taking study 
  skills strategies such as guided notes, strategic note taking, AWARE 
  notes, and columnar formats. *Guided notes* help students guide 
  through lectures. Teachers provide outlines that contain the main idea 
  and related concepts. In addition, as information is presented, students
  can fill in the missing content into blanks where key facts should be. *Strategic note-taking* help students take good notes. For instance, it helps students summarize and organize key points. *A.W.A.R.E* note staking strategy helps students record lectures and take notes. This strategy is arranged into five steps. *A-Arrange notes, W-Write quickly, A-Apply cues, R-Review notes, E-Edit notes.*
  
  Third, *organizing materials and managing time* requires
  time management study strategy skills. Time management study skills 
  help students manage their time efficiently. For instance, it teaches 
  students how to estimate their time, schedule time, and monitor their 
  schedule. *Estimating time* helps students estimate how long it will take to complete a task. *Schedule time* helps schedule their time by using timelines. This approach will give 
  students a better idea of when to start an assignment or project. 
  Monitoring schedule allows students to create a checklist to monitor 
  what tasks have been completed. Lastly, *selecting, monitoring and using strategies* requires
  four self-regulation study strategy skills. Self-monitoring, 
  self-instruction, goal setting, and self-reinforcement are used to help 
  students apply cognitive strategies and how to determine if they are 
  successful.
  

2. Name four self-regulation strategies and describe how each can help a student become a more independent learner.
  

- Majority of students with learning difficulties and learning 
  disabilities need strategies that will help them stay on track. Teaching
   self-regulation strategies foster students to be actively involved in 
  their own learning. For instance, instead of teachers being responsible 
  for monitoring students academic progress, the students will be 
  responsible for monitoring their progress on their own. In addition, 
  self-regulation strategies help students select and monitor learning 
  strategies. Students who are capable of using learning strategies 
  effectively, know where and why to use a particular strategy, whereas, 
  students who do not possess the same opportunities have difficulties 
  with academic strategies. For instance, students will use ineffective 
  strategies for all academic tasks. In order to be successful, students 
  must be responsible for their own learning. To do so, students must 
  adopt self-regulation strategies. The four self-regulation strategies 
  are *self-monitoring, self instruction, goal setting, and self-reinforcement.*

*Self-monitoring* strategies provide immediate feedback to 
students, depicts improvement, and enable students to be aware of their 
behavior. There are several ways students can monitor their progress. 
Students can monitor their progress by using checklists, self-monitoring
 sheets, and self-monitoring log. For example, a self-monitoring 
checklist can be utilized for editing assignments. But, if a student is 
having difficulties completing tasks such as submitting homework, they 
can use checklists that aims towards specific behavior. *Self-instruction* strategies are when students use encouraging statements that will help 
them cope through different situations. Some situations are working 
through a task, coping with a difficult situation, and rewarding 
themselves. *Goal-setting* strategies help students establish 
goals and increase student’s attention and motivation. Short term goals 
are considered Students who have difficulty completing tasks on time. 
Teachers can help students establish short-term goals. When setting 
goals, students should identify goals, develop and implement plans, and 
revise goals. Self-reinforcement occurs when individuals choose 
reinforcements and rewards for reaching or exceeding a goal. 
Goal-setting are beneficial for students because it produces improvement
 in performance, and engages students in their learning.

3. Imagine that you are a middle school social studies teacher. A number of
  your students are struggling with basic study skills. You want to help 
  all of your students to become more effective learners.
  
  1. Choose a graphic organizer to help your students more easily see the 
    relationship between election processes in the early 1900s and today. 
    Explain why you chose this type of graphic organizer.

- The graphic organizer that will help students see the relationship 
  between election processes in the early 1900s and today would be a Venn 
  diagram. A Venn diagram is an organizer that is used to show the 
  overlapping relationship between different categories, as well as, what 
  is unique to each. Some categories are events, things, and ideas. For 
  example, students will write how the two subjects are different in the 
  outer circles, and write how they are alike in the overlapping areas. 
  For example, once students complete the Venn diagram, they will see that
   the relationship between the election process in the early 1900s and 
  today is that elections are held on November 6 and have Democratic and 
  Republican parties.
  
  2. Select one note-taking strategy to help your students to take effective 
    notes to study for a test. Explain why you chose this strategy.
- The *strategic note-taking strategy* will help students take effective notes to study for a test, coupled with the *CUES strategy*.
   First and foremost, strategic note-taking allows students to record 
  notes by clustering the main points and summarizing each point during a 
  lecture. Clustering ideas help students remember the information and 
  summarizing aids them in monitoring comprehension and storing 
  information in their long-term memory. While teaching students how to 
  effectively use strategic note-taking strategies, teachers could 
  implement the *CUES strategy.* The C (Cluster) students will 
  divide content relating to the content that is being presented. U (Use) 
  is steps that are used by students while recording points from a 
  lecture. Students will use teacher cues to help them discern important 
  information. in addition, students should be attentive to number cues. 
  For example, *“There are six types of…”* and important cues *“This strategy is important because…”.*, E (Enter) students would be reminded to enter key terms, and the S (summarize) students will summarize lecture points.
  
  3. You want to introduce a mnemonic strategy to help your students learn 
    the first ten elements in the periodic chart. Select the type of 
    mnemonic strategy (or combination of strategies) you would use for this 
    task and explain why you chose it. Show how you would apply this 
    strategy for teaching the first ten elements of the periodic chart.
- Science, engineering, and math classes can be challenging and require a 
  lot of time to study the formulas and concepts. But, once students 
  become familiar with them, they will be successful in the classroom. One
   method for remembering a large amount of information is the use of 
  mnemonics. Also, it is effective in different grade levels, content 
  areas, and different settings. The 1st letter strategy mnemonic strategy will be used to help students learn the first ten elements in the periodic chart. The 1st letter strategy helps students remember information. In addition, this 
  mnemonic strategy instruction is effective with students with learning 
  disabilities. The two methods of teaching the 1st letter strategy are acronyms and acrostic. An *acronym* is a word whose individual letter represents the first letter of each word, whereas, an *acrostic* is a phrase that uses the first letter of each word that represents the
   first letter of information. In light of this case, the acrostic 
  strategy is most effective. The acrostic strategy is beneficial for 
  students because it helps them recall lists of information. For example,
   Science: The elements of the periodic table (*H-hydrogen, HE-Helium, LI-Lithium, BE-Beryllium, B-Boron, C-Carbon, N-Nitrogen, O-Oxygen, F-Fluorine, and N-Neon).* *<u>H</u>oney, <u>H</u>elps, <u>Li</u>ttle, <u>B</u>ees, <u>B</u>ring, <u>C</u>ountless, <u>N</u>ibbles, <u>O</u>f, <u>F</u>un, <u>N</u>icely.* This mnemonic strategy will help students memorize the names, symbols and the positions of the elements of the periodic table.
  
  4. Imagine that you are a high school teacher. You have noticed that 
    several of your students have difficulty completing their homework on 
    time. One strategy that might be helpful for these students is A-WATCH. 
    Using what you have learned in this module, explain why this strategy 
    might be effective.
- *The acronym A-WATCH stands for, A- Assignment notebook, W-write down
   the assignment and due date, A- ask for clarification on the 
  assignment, T-task-analyze the assignment, C-check work for errors, 
  accuracy, and neatness, H- hand in the assignment.* The A-WATCH 
  strategy might be an effective strategy because it can be considered a 
  self-management strategy. For instance, this strategy can be proven 
  effective for students with learning disabilities who have difficulty 
  completing tasks individually. Also, the A-WTCH strategy will teach 
  students with learning disabilities self-instruction, how to achieve and
   set goals, and evaluate their work. Students are more likely to become 
  successful in completing long-term assignments if they organize how they
   will approach them and plan accordingl*y.* In addition, this 
  strategy can help student’s complete assignments efficiently, especially
   long-term assignments. Long-term assignments are typically due in 
  several days or weeks and include projects and book reports. The A-WATCH
   strategy can be used to help student’s complete academic assignments 
  accurately by helping them plan and organize their assignments.
  

#### Wrap up

Students with learning disabilities struggle academically. One main 
reason why students struggle is due to deficits in executive functions, 
the mental processes that control activities related to learning. The 
activities that are related to learning are *Processing information, 
Retaining and Recalling Information, Organizing Materials and Time, and 
Using Effective Learning and Study Strategies.* Due to the deficits 
in executive function processes, it is imperative that students should 
be taught explicitly how to approach academic tasks. In addition, 
students need to be taught study strategy skills. There are several 
study skills strategies that can help students who struggle with 
executive functions or activities related to learning. When it comes to *Processing Information,* students can use graphic organizers. Graphic organizers help students process information easily. *Retaining and Recalling Information,* a note-taking study strategy skill helps students understand 
information that is presented, organize information and become actively 
engaged with the content. In addition, mnemonics is another study 
strategy skill that corresponds with retaining and recalling 
information. Mnemonic strategies are presented in the form of visual and
 auditory clues that help students make meaningful connections between 
prior knowledge and new information. *Organizing Materials and managing* time consists of the organization of materials and time management. 
Organizing materials keep students organized. For example, being 
organized help students keep their personal belongings such as their 
desks, lockers, and book bags. Practicing this skill will foster success
 and reduce frustration. Time-management is important because it helps 
students manage their time effectively. In addition, it helps students 
estimate time, schedule time, and monitor schedules. Last but not least,
 *Selecting, Monitoring, and Using Strategies* consist of 
self-regulation study strategies. Self-regulation strategies help 
students to utilize learning strategies. There are four self-regulation 
strategies that will help students become an active member of their 
learning such as self-monitoring, self-instruction, goal-setting, and 
self-reinforcement. Each of these strategies can be used separately or 
together. For example, if a student is not making adequate progress, she
 could ask herself *why* and talk herself through the problem. 
Therefore, it is important to teach study strategy skills strategies to 
students, especially to students with learning disabilities.
