Blower Wheel is the most important component of a centrifugal fan and the overall performance and efficiency is dependent on it. More powerful design of the blower wheel by Canada Blower improved the integrity of reinforced blades on backward curved and airfoil fans. Made of thicker gauge material and with several reinforcement options, this design is the answer when nothing else will do.

This feature doubles the dignity and expectations of higher efficiency. Development was carried out by leading engineers in the industry who have made a significant contribution to make a blower wheel more efficient. Hence, retrofitting of a blower wheel can be done with reinforcement of blades.

In this process our engineers design a new impeller by considering the parameters such as air-flow rate, system resistance, density of gas at the inlet, site altitude and temperature of gases inlet of the existing fan. With the above points taking into consideration, an impeller is designed having a diameter which is almost nearer to the existing one, so that it fits perfectly in the casing without any necessity for modification or replacement.

Several factors are to be considered when material to be handled is going through the fan system. Choosing a fan with proper blade type is important otherwise the material will be accumulated on the blades. For clean air applications backward curved and airfoil blades with reinforcement are very efficient, whereas if the material is dirty and granular, radial wheels are appropriate.

In order to produce the highest performance wheels on the market, our laboratory tests our reinforced blower wheels under these high-stress levels to gain an understanding of where wheels can be redesigned and enhanced to avoid any deformation. These over-speed tests are imperative to finding solutions for customers who need high performance wheels with durability they can trust.

While handling moist or wet materials, fans with special coatings or material liners need to be used for wheels to avoid material corrosion and abrasion.

Coming to reinforcement of industrial blower wheels has many advantages and can be easily performed with less investment and in less time period.
