Globalization brings many changes to people’s lives all over the
world. There are several definitions of globalization however the k
Merriam-Webster meaning is as follows. Globalization is the process by
which businesses and other organizations develop international influence
or start operating on an international scale. From shifting social
norms around the globe to changing how countries do business,
technological advances, and intensifying competition in the workforce,
as well as, the educational field; effects of globalization are
everywhere and far reaching (Carnoy, 2002).

Globalization effects education all over the world. For example, due
to intricate technological advances many jobs have been digitized. This
means that the skill set that’s required for jobs have changed
dramatically. Subsequently, jobs that could once be sustained by someone
with a high school diploma or less have disappeared. These global and
economic changes cause shifts in the job market and are essentially
changing what is needed from the education system. We now need to
prepare students for jobs that require different skill sets. Employees
must now be knowledgeable on foreign languages, cultures, and overall
way of business to be successful in their career. For the most part the
United States has been a leader in education compared to other
countries. Being the first country to achieve mass collegiate education,
the United States of America always had the highest number of qualified
people in its labor force. This is how the American economy was able to
thrive and take advantage of the global market. But does this
globalization led to development or division in education? (Welch &
Mok, 2003) Well, in recent years countries around the world have
refocused on expanding education, many of the smaller, more impoverished
countries actually working *together* to do so. Since graduating
high school is now the standard in most countries, many are now setting
goals to increase the number of college attendees even working with the
United Nations to provide education for all countries! Although the
United States has a greater number of older workers that are well
educated, many other countries have a greater number of young workers
with college degrees. Nonetheless, with more high school graduates
chasing college degrees and older people pursuing higher education after
so many years of being out of school; this is changing too. People of
all ages are pursuing higher education all over the world and with
education standards changing as well, we are truly living in an era like
never before. We are all preparing for an interconnected world that
globalization has brought to us and education is just one small stepping
stone for the high skill economy of the future (Young 1998, Brown et
al. 2001).

The growing importance of education is more than wanting our
citizens to be smart. Countries are wanting their citizens to get
educated in order to build for a future in which we are one global
citizen class that works together economically and otherwise to grow our
countries. This can help with foreign policy and international business
transactions and trades. To be knowledgeable of a certain country is to
be more accepting and understanding of said countries culture and
beliefs. Appearing welcoming and friendly to different cultures will
attract investments from foreign countries. This will boost the
country’s economy (see OECD 1998, Campbell 2000). With a larger economy a
countries revenue with increase and strengthen the country (ideally).
This is another reason why the quality of education is so important.

While education systems all over the world are working on
improving and developing new ways to teach people; there is another way
people are gaining more and more knowledge in today society. The
internet. Not only is the use of computers and the internet now more
common in the classroom it has also grown more common in everyday life
(Martin Carnoy, 1999, pp.15-17). By using the internet society has
access to different kinds of information instantaneously. This makes
gaining knowledge for students as well as non-students easier and faster
than ever before. This is great when used as a means for students
struggling to comprehend course material or certain concepts, but with
such a wide variety of information available, and it is important
learners are able to distinguish between dependable and untrustworthy
resources. However for countries such as China or Iran who have limited
to no access online; this can make a learning different concepts or
gaining certain knowledge difficult because their governments often
block or edit information. Therefore citizens of those countries or
countries similar may actually have a skewed since of the truth because
not *all* information is given to them. In a way this widens the
gap between the education progress of a developed country and an
underdeveloped country/country who may be banned from viewing certain
material. With technological advances making their way all around the
globe (globalization), eventually all countries will have access to any
information they desire.

Globalization is a powerful and important process that influences
economies, education systems, politics, and even social customs. With a
growing sense of oneness; or “we are all global citizens in one world”
outlooks, globalizations *positive* and increasing impact on education and societies growing desire to become more educated is obvious.
