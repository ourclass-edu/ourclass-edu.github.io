{"I9JHBFuWUcYot74x":{"name":"Ourclass Team","bio":"Victoria Lee grew up in Durham, North Carolina, where she spent twelve ascetic years as a vegetarian before discovering spicy chicken wings are, in fact, a delicacy. She’s been a state finalist competitive pianist, a hitchhiker, a pizza connoisseur, an EMT, an ex-pat in China and Sweden, and a science doctoral student. She’s also a bit of a snob about fancy whiskey. Victoria writes early in the morning, then spends the rest of the day trying to impress her Border collie puppy and make her experiments work.","dp":"/assets/files/route101.jpg"},"cDrqyokDIqZGVUmb":{"name":"Sasi","bio":"sasi mestiris","dp":"/assets/files/screenshot.jpg"},"ooxilorvFDzBdpgC":{"name":"sasikuttan","bio":"kuttan sasi","dp":"/assets/files/phone_repair.jpg"}}
